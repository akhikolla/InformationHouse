\title{Prevention of numerical instability for a new observation}
\usage{
checkPredict(x, model, threshold = 1e-04, distance = "euclidean", type = "UK")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector representing the input to check, alternatively a matrix with one point per row,}

\item{model}{list of objects of class \code{\link[DiceKriging]{km}}, one for each objective functions,}

\item{threshold}{optional value for the minimal distance to an existing observation, default to \code{1e-4},}

\item{distance}{selection of the distance between new observations, between "\code{euclidean}" (default), "\code{none}",
"\code{covdist}" and "\code{covratio}", see details,}

\item{type}{"\code{SK}" or "\code{UK}" (default), depending whether uncertainty related to trend estimation has to be taken into account.}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} if the point should not be tested.
}
\description{
Check that the new point is not too close to already known observations to avoid numerical issues.
Closeness can be estimated with several distances.
}
\details{
If the distance between \code{x} and the closest observations in \code{model} is below
 \code{threshold}, \code{x} should not be evaluated to avoid numerical instabilities.
The distance can simply be the Euclidean distance or the canonical distance associated with the kriging predictive covariance k: 
  \deqn{d(x,y) = \sqrt{k(x,x) - 2k(x,y) + k(y,y)}.}{d(x,y) = \sqrt(k(x,x) - 2k(x,y) + k(y,y)).} 
  The last solution is the ratio between the prediction variance at \code{x} and the variance of the process.
  \code{none} can be used, e.g., if points have been selected already.
