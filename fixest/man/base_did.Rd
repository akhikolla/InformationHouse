\description{
This data has been generated to illustrate the use of difference in difference functions in package \pkg{fixest}. This is a balanced panel of 104 individuals and 10 periods. About half the individuals are treated, the treatment having a positive effect on the dependent variable \code{y} after the 5th period. The effect of the treatment on \code{y} is gradual.
