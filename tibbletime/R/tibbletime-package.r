#' tibbletime: time-aware tibbles
#'
#' Built on top of the 'tibble' package, 'tibbletime' is an extension
#' that allows for the creation of time aware tibbles. Some immediate
#' advantages of this include: the ability to perform time based subsetting
#' on tibbles, quickly summarising and aggregating results by time periods,
#' and calling functions similar in spirit to the map family from 'purrr'
#' on time based tibbles.
