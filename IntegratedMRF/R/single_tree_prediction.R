#' Prediction of Testing Samples for single tree
#' 
#' Predicts the output responses of testing samples based on the input regression tree
#'  
#' @param Single_Model Random Forest or Multivariate Random Forest Model of a particular tree
#' @param X_test Testing samples of size Q x N, Q is the number of testing samples and N is the number of features (same order and
#' size used as training) 
#' @param Variable_number Number of Output Features 
#' @return Prediction result of the Testing samples for a particular tree
#' @details 
#' A regression tree model contains splitting criteria for all the splits in the tree and output responses of training 
#' samples in the leaf nodes. A testing sample using these criteria will reach a leaf node and the average of the 
#' Output response vectors in the leaf node is considered as the prediction of the testing sample.
