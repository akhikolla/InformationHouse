\title{Approximate Computation of Wasserstein Distances via Subsampling.}
\usage{
subwasserstein(source, target, S, K = 1, p = 1, costM = NULL,
  prob = TRUE, precompute = FALSE, method = "networkflow")
}
\arguments{
\item{source}{The source measure has to be either a weight vector or an object
of one of the classes \code{"pgrid"}, \code{"wpp"} or \code{"pp"}.}

\item{target}{The target measure needs to be of the same type as the source measure.}

\item{S}{The sample size.}

\item{K}{The number of tries. Defaults to 1.}

\item{p}{The order of the Wasserstein metric (i.e. the power of the distances). Defaults to 1.}

\item{costM}{The cost matrix between the source and target measures. Ignored unless source
and target are weight vectors.}

\item{prob}{logical. Should the objects a, b be interpreted as probability measures, i.e. their
total mass be normalized to 1?}

\item{precompute}{logical. Should the cost matrix for the large problem be precomputed?}

\item{method}{A string with the name of the method used for optimal transport distance computation.
Options are "networkflow", revsimplex", "shortsimplex" and "primaldual".}
}
\value{
The mean of the K values of the Wasserstein distances between
        the subsampled measures.
}
\description{
Samples \code{S} elements each of a source and a target measure and
computes the Wasserstein distance between the samples.
The mean distance out of \code{K} tries is returned.
}
\details{
For larger problems setting \code{precompute} to \code{TRUE} is not recommended.
