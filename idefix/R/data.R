#' Discrete choice design.
#' 
#' This discrete choice design is generated using the \code{\link{Modfed}} 
#' function. There are 8 choice sets, each containig 2 alternatives (rows). The
#' alternatives consist of 3 attributes (time, price, comfort) with 3
#' levels each, all of which are dummy coded (columns).
