2.1.0   2019-08-01

MAJOR CHANGES
    o   The pi_inv argument (formerly a numeric N*K matrix with the observed top-ordering) has been redefined as an object of class `top_ordering` or an object that can be coerced with the new function as.top_ordering.
    o   gibbsPLMIX(...): 
    o   [::] added the element `objective` in the output list representing the objective function values (that is the kernel of the log-posterior distribution) sampled in the saved MCMC iterations.  
    o   mapPLMIX(...):
    o   [::] recoded default value of the argument `plot_objective` from TRUE to FALSE.
    o   make_complete(...), make_partial(...), paired_comparisons(...), rank_ord_switch(...) and rank_summaries(...): 
    o   [::] renamed argument `format` as `format_input`.
    o   [::] deleted default value ("ordering") for the former argument `format`.
    o   rPLMIX(...): 
    o   [::] renamed argument `format` as `format_output`.
    o   selectPLMIX(...): 
    o   [::] renamed argument `post_summary` as `post_est`.
    o   `d_apa`, `d_carconf`, `d_dublinwest`, `d_german`, `d_nascar`, `d_occup` and `d_rice` 
    o   [::] appended S3 class `top_ordering` to the supplied top-ordering datasets.      
    o   [::] renamed columns of the supplied top-ordering datasets.      
   
MINOR CHANGES
    o   fixed a CRAN error due to the cleanEX(...) procedure in the R CMD check. 
    o   mapPLMIX(...): 
    o   [::] reversed order between the `P_map` and `W_map` elements in the output list.
    o   rank_ord_switch(...):
    o   [::] added names to the columns of the output matrix.
    o   unit_to_freq(...):
    o   [::] added name `freq` to the last column of the output matrix.

NEW FEATURES
    o   Added the new membership function is.top_ordering(...) that verifies whether the supplied data satisfy the conditions to be a top-ordering dataset (various object classes are accepted for the input data).
    o   Added the new coercion function as.top_ordering(...) that attempts to coerce the supplied data into an object of S3 class `top_ordering` (various object classes and forms are accepted for the input data).
    o   Appended S3 class `mpPLMIX` to the list returned by mapPLMIX(...) and mapPLMIX_multistart(...).
    o   Added generic S3 class methods for objects of class `mpPLMIX` named as print.mpPLMIX(...), summary.mpPLMIX(...) and plot.mpPLMIX(...).
    o   Appended S3 class `gsPLMIX` to the list returned by gibbsPLMIX(...).
    o   Added generic S3 class methods for objects of class `gsPLMIX` named as print.gsPLMIX(...), summary.gsPLMIX(...) and plot.gsPLMIX(...).
    o   Added the new function gsPLMIX_to_mcmc(...) to coerce an object of class `gsPLMIX` into an object of class `mcmc` as defined by the function as.mcmc(...) of the `coda` package.
    o   Added two further datasets called `d_occup` and `d_rice`.
    o   Added packages `coda`, `ggmcmc`, `ggplot2`, `radarchart`, `prefmod`, `rankdist`, `StatRank`, `pmr`, `PlackettLuce`, `utils` and `reshape2` in Imports.

DOCUMENTATION
    o   The manual has been globally reviewed and improved accordingly with the new changes and the additional implementations described in NEW FEATURES.
    o   label_switchPLMIX(...):
    o   [::] added the citation Papastamoulis, P. (2016).


2.0.1   2018-05-02

MINOR CHANGES
    o   fixed former warnings using if() with conditions of length greater than one. We have also checked the current version with _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_ set to true. 
    o   gibbsPLMIX(...):
    o   [::] colnames added to output values labelled as `P` and `W`.
    o   mapPLMIX(...):
    o   [::] dimnames change for output value labelled as `P_map`.
    o   [::] names added to output value labelled as `W_map`.
    o   rank_summaries(...):
    o   [::] format and label change for the former output value labelled as `missing_pos` now labelled as `na_or_not`.
    o   [::] output values labelled as `mean_rank` and `marginals` now contain dimnames.
