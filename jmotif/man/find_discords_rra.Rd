\title{Finds a discord with RRA (Rare Rule Anomaly) algorithm.
Usually works the best with higher than that for HOT-SAX sizes of discretization parameters
(i.e., PAA and Alphabet sizes).}
\usage{
find_discords_rra(
  series,
  w_size,

\arguments{
\item{series}{the input timeseries.}

\item{w_size}{the sliding window size.}

\item{paa_size}{the PAA size.}

\item{a_size}{the alphabet size.}
