\title{
Present value of a series of cash flows.
}
\description{
This function evaluates the present values of a series of cash flows, given occurrence time.
Probabilities of occurrence can also be taken into account.
}
\usage{
presentValue(cashFlows, timeIds, interestRates, probabilities,power=1)
}

\arguments{
  \item{cashFlows}{
Vector of cashFlow, must be coherent with \code{timeIds}
}
  \item{timeIds}{
	Vector of points of time where \code{cashFlows} are due.
}
  \item{interestRates}{
	A numeric value or a time-size vector of interest rate used to discount cahs flow.
}
  \item{probabilities}{
	Optional vector of probabilities.
}
  \item{power}{
	Power to square discount and cash flows. Default is set to 1
}
}
\details{
	\code{probabilities} is optional, a sequence of 1 length of timeIds is assumed.
	Interest rate shall be a fixed number or a vector of the same size of \code{timeIds}. \code{power} parameters is generally useless 
	beside life contingencies insurances evaluations.
}
\value{
	A numeric value representing the present value of cashFlows vector, or the 
	actuarial present value if probabilities are provided.
