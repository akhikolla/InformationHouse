\title{
	Increasing annuity.
}
\description{
	This function evaluates non - stochastic increasing annuities.
}
\usage{
	increasingAnnuity(i, n, type = "immediate")
}

\arguments{
  \item{i}{
	A numeric value representing the interest rate.
}
  \item{n}{
	The number of periods.
}
  \item{type}{
The Payment type, either \code{"advance"} for the annuity due (default)
or \code{"arrears"} for the annuity immediate.
Alternatively, one can use \code{"due"} or \code{"immediate"}
	respectively (can be abbreviated).
}
}
\details{
	An increasing annuity shows the following flow of payments: \eqn{1,2,\ldots,n-1,n}
}
\value{
	The value of the annuity.
