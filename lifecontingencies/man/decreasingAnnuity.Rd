\title{
	Function to evaluate decreasing annuities.
}
\description{
	This function return present values for decreasing annuities - certain.
}
\usage{
decreasingAnnuity(i, n,type="immediate")
}

\arguments{
  \item{i}{
	A numeric value representing the interest rate.
}
  \item{n}{
	The number of periods.
}
  \item{type}{
The Payment type, either \code{"advance"} for the annuity due (default)
or \code{"arrears"} for the annuity immediate.
Alternatively, one can use \code{"due"} or \code{"immediate"}
	respectively (can be abbreviated).
}
}
\details{
	A decreasing annuity has the following flows of payments: n, n-1, n-2, \ldots, 1, 0.
}
\value{
	A numeric value reporting the present value of the decreasing cash flows.

\examples{
	#the present value of 10, 9, 8,....,0 payable at the end of the period
	#for 10 years is
	decreasingAnnuity(i=0.03, n=10)
	#assuming a 3% interest rate
	#should be
	sum((10:1)/(1+.03)^(1:10))
