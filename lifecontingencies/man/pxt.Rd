\title{Functions to evaluate survival, death probabilities and deaths.}
\description{These functions evaluate raw survival and death probabilities between age x and x+t}
\usage{
dxt(object, x, t, decrement)
pxt(object, x, t, fractional = "linear", decrement)
qxt(object, x, t, fractional = "linear", decrement)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{A \code{lifetable} object.}
  \item{x}{Age of life \code{x}. (can be a vector for \code{pxt, qxt}).}
  \item{t}{Period until which the age shall be evaluated. Default value is 1.
  (can be a vector for \code{pxt, qxt}).}
  \item{fractional}{Assumptions for fractional age. One of \code{"linear"}, 
  \code{"hyperbolic"}, \code{"constant force"} (can be abbreviated).}
  \item{decrement}{The reason of decrement (only for \code{mdt} class objects). Can be either an ordinal number or the
  name of decrement}
 }
\details{
	Fractional assumptions are:
	\itemize{
		\item linear: linear interpolation between consecutive ages, i.e. assume uniform distribution.
		\item constant force of mortality : constant force of mortality, also known as exponential interpolation.
		\item hyperbolic: Balducci assumption, also known as harmonic interpolation. 
		}
	Note that \code{fractional="uniform"}, \code{"exponential"}, \code{"harmonic"} or \code{"Balducci"}
	is also authorized.
	See references for details.
