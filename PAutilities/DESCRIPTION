Description: A collection of utilities that are useful for a broad range of
    tasks that are common in physical activity research, including the
    following: creation of Bland-Altman plots, formatted descriptive
    statistics, metabolic calculations (e.g. basal metabolic rate predictions)
    and conversions, demographic calculations (age and age-for-body-mass-index
    percentile), bout analysis of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical
    activity, and analysis of bout detection algorithm performance.
