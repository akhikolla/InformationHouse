# PAutilities

This package provides utilities to support a range of tasks in physical
activity research. These include the items in the list below, which is
expected to grow and mature over time. Thus, feature/pull requests are
encouraged.

  - Bland-Altman plots
  - Bouted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity analysis
  - Formatted descriptive statistics
  - Demographic calculations (age, BMI-for-age percentile)
  - Metabolic calculations (energy expenditure conversions, basal
    metabolic rate predictions)
  - Analysis of bout detection algorithm performance
  - Paired equivalence testing (including a plot method)
  - Activity intensity classification from metabolic equivalents and (if
    available) posture
  - Indexed run length encoding
