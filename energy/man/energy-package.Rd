 E-statistics: Multivariate Inference via the Energy of Data
}
\description{
Description: E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate inference,
             including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and multi-sample tests for
             comparing multivariate distributions, are implemented. Measuring and testing
             multivariate independence based on distance correlation, partial distance
             correlation, multivariate goodness-of-fit tests, clustering based on energy distance,
             testing for multivariate normality, distance components (disco) for non-parametric
             analysis of structured data, and other energy statistics/methods are implemented.
