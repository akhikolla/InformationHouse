\title{
Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit Data
}


\description{
Implements a class of univariate and multivariate spatial generalised linear mixed 
models for areal unit data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian, 
multinomial, Poisson or zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and spatial autocorrelation 
is modelled by  a set of random effects that are assigned a conditional 
autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of different models are 
available for univariate spatial data, including models with no random effects as 
well as random effects modelled by different types of CAR prior, including the 
BYM model (Besag et al. (1991) <doi:10.1007/BF00116466>), the Leroux model 
(Leroux et al. (2000) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-1284-3_4>) and the localised model 
(Lee et al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/env.2348>). Additionally,  a multivariate CAR 
(MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data is available, as is a two-level 
hierarchical  model for modelling data relating to individuals within areas. Full 
details are given in the vignette accompanying this package. The initial creation 
of this package was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) 
grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development has been supported by the 
Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1, ESRC 
grant ES/K006460/1, Innovate UK / Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) 
grant NE/N007352/1 and the TB Alliance.
