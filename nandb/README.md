Calculation of molecular number and brightness from fluorescence
microscopy image series. The software was published in a [2016
paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx434). The seminal paper
for the technique is [Digman et
al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.107.114645). A
[review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.12.001) of the technique
was published in [2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.12.001).

## Installation

You can install the release version of `nandb` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nandb) with:

``` r
install.packages("nandb")
```

You can install the (unstable) development version of `nandb` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rorynolan/nandb/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rorynolan/nandb")
```

I highly recommend using the release version. The dev version is just
for the ultra-curious and should be thought of as unreliable.

## How to use the package
