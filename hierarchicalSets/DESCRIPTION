Title: Set Data Visualization Using Hierarchies

Description: Pure set data visualization approaches are often limited in
    scalability due to the combinatorial explosion of distinct set families as
    the number of sets under investigation increases. hierarchicalSets applies
    a set centric hierarchical clustering of the sets under investigation and
    uses this hierarchy as a basis for a range of scalable visual
    representations. hierarchicalSets is especially well suited for collections
    of sets that describe comparable comparable entities as it relies on the
    sets to have a meaningful relational structure.
