\title{
  Fraction Subtraction Data
}

\description{
  Tatsuoka's (1984) fraction subtraction data set is comprised of
  responses to \eqn{J=20} fraction subtraction test items from \eqn{N=536}
  middle school students.
}

\usage{
  data(fraction.subtraction.data)
}

\format{
  The \code{fraction.subtraction.data} data frame consists of 536
  rows and 20 columns, representing the responses of the \eqn{N=536}
  students to each of the \eqn{J=20} test items.  Each row in the data set
  corresponds to the responses of a particular student.  Thereby a "1"
  denotes that a correct response was recorded, while "0" denotes an
  incorrect response.  The other way round, each column corresponds
  to all responses to a particular item.
}

\details{
  The items used for the fraction subtraction test originally appeared
  in Tatsuoka (1984) and are published in Tatsuoka (2002).  They
  can also be found in DeCarlo (2011).  All test items are based on 8
  attributes (e.g. convert a whole number to a fraction, separate a whole
  number from a fraction or simplify before subtracting).  The complete
  list of skills can be found in \code{\link{fraction.subtraction.qmatrix}}.
