Installation
------------

The `spsann` package was created to help you creating optimum spatial
sample configurations using the power of spatial simulated annealing. It
can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spsann)
using:

    install.packages(pkgs = "spsann")

The development version of `spsann`, available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/samuel-rosa/spsann), can be downloaded --
using the `devtools` package -- with:

    if (!require(devtools)) {
      install.packages(pkgs = "devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("samuel-rosa/spsann")

How to collaborate
------------------

We use the *fork & pull* collaborative development model. This means
that you are free to make a parallel copy of this repository, change the
source code as you see fit, and then *push* the changes to your personal
copy of this repository. All this without requiring any authorization.
If the changes you've made to your personal copy of this repository are
interesting and you're willing to share them with us, then just have
them pulled -- *pull request* -- to this repository. After reviewing the
changes, we will decide whether they can be merged -- *merge* -- with
the source code of this repository.
