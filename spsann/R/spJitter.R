#' Random perturbation of spatial points
#' 
#' Randomly perturb (\sQuote{jitter}) the coordinates of spatial points.
#' 
#' @param points Data frame or matrix with three columns in the following order: \code{[, "id"]} the row 
#' indexes of \code{candi} that correspond to each point, \code{[, "x"]} the projected x-coordinates, and 
#' \code{[, "y"]} the projected y-coordinates. Note that \code{points} must be a subset of \code{candi}.
#'
#' @param candi Data frame or matrix with the candidate locations for the jittered points. \code{candi} must 
#' have two columns in the following order: \code{[, "x"]} the projected x-coordinates, and \code{[, "y"]} the 
#' projected y-coordinates.
#'
#' @param x.max,x.min,y.max,y.min Numeric value defining the minimum and maximum quantity of random noise to 
#' be added to the projected x- and y-coordinates. The minimum quantity should be equal to, at least, the 
#' minimum distance between two neighbouring candidate locations. The units are the same as of the projected 
#' x- and y-coordinates. If missing, they are estimated from \code{candi}.
#' 
#' @param cellsize Vector with two numeric values defining the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) spacing 
#' between the candidate locations in \code{candi}. A single value can be used if the spacing in the x- and 
#' y-coordinates is the same. If \code{cellsize = 0} then \pkg{spsann} understands that a finite set of
#' candidate locations is being used (See Details).
#' 
#' @param which.point Integer values defining which point should be perturbed.

#' \subsection{Jittering methods}{
#' There are multiple mechanism to generate a new sample configuration out of the current sample configuration.
#' The main step consists of randomly perturbing the coordinates of a sample point, a process known as 
#' \sQuote{jittering}. These mechanisms can be classified based on how the set of candidate locations is 
#' defined. For example, one could use an \emph{infinite} set of candidate locations, that is, any location 
#' in the sampling region can be selected as the new location of a jittered point. All that is needed is 
#' a polygon indicating the boundary of the sampling region. This method is the most computationally demanding
#' because every time a point is jittered, it is necessary to check if the point falls in sampling region.
#' 
#' Another approach consists of using a \emph{finite} set of candidate locations for the jittered points. A
#' finite set of candidate locations is created by discretising the sampling region, that is, creating a fine 
#' grid of points that serve as candidate locations for the jittered point. This is the least computationally
#' demanding jittering method because, by definition, the jittered point will always fall in the sampling
#' region.
#' 
#' Using a finite set of candidate locations has two important inconveniences. First, not all locations in 
#' the sampling region can be selected as the new location for a jittered point. Second, when a point is 
#' jittered, it may be that the new location already is occupied by another point. If this happens, another 
#' location has to be iteratively sought for, say, as many times as the number of points in the sample. In 
#' general, the more points there are in the sample, the more likely it is that the new location already is 
#' occupied by another point. If a solution is not found in a reasonable time, the point selected to be 
#' jittered is kept in its original location. Such a procedure clearly is suboptimal.
#' 
#' \pkg{spsann} uses a more elegant method which is based on using a finite set of candidate locations coupled
#' with a form of \emph{two-stage random sampling} as implemented in 
#' \code{[spsample](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spcosa)}. Because 
#' the candidate locations are placed on a finite regular grid, they can be seen as the centre nodes of 
#' a finite set of grid cells (or pixels of a raster image). In the first stage, one of the \dQuote{grid 
#' cells} is selected with replacement, i.e. independently of already being occupied by another sample point. 
#' The new location for the point chosen to be jittered is selected within that \dQuote{grid cell} by simple
#' random sampling. This method guarantees that virtually any location in the sampling region can be selected. 
#' It also discards the need to check if the new location already is occupied by another point, speeding up 
#' the computations when compared to the first two approaches.
#' }
#' 
#' @note 
#' The distance between two points is computed as the Euclidean distance between them. This computation 
#' assumes that the optimization is operating in the two-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. the coordinates of
#' the sample points and candidate locations should not be provided as latitude/longitude. \pkg{spsann} has no
#' mechanism to check if the coordinates are projected: the user is responsible for making sure that this
#' requirement is attained.
#' 
#' @return
#' A matrix with the jittered projected coordinates of the points.
