##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE:
##  Natively tuned 64-bit binaries for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and newer 
##  with prerequisite libraries provided by HomeBrew package manager
##

## Inherits from basic Darwin configuration
include $(TOP)/config/platform/darwin

## Make sure that Apple's gcc is used (not e.g. a fink-installed version)
CC = /usr/bin/gcc

## Tune for CPU of the build machine, compiling only 64-bit code
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -arch x86_64 -mtune=native

DEPEND_CFLAGS = -Wall -O3

## Use stable paths to HomeBrew installed Glib, PCRE and Readline libraries,
## so binaries will continue to work if prerequisites are updated.
