##  SITE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILE: Windows binaries cross-compiled via MinGW
##

## Note that directories here always refer to locations on the eventual Windows
## machine where things will be installed - whereas in the "platform" config
## files, some paths may refer to a Unix machine where the Windows programs are
## being cross-compiled. 

## Directory tree where binaries, libraries, header files and man pages will be installed
## We can use the Windows environment variable, but we will need to allow an override at 
## install time.
PREFIX = %ProgramFiles%\CWB

## Install locations are given to override the default paths, which include /s
BININSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\bin
MANINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\share\man
LIBINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\lib
INCINSTDIR = $(PREFIX)\include\cwb

## Default registry directory (used unless -r option or CORPUS_REGISTRY variable is set)
## For Windows, the best guess is that the right drive is C:, and a CWB folder exists
## Note: \\\\ needed for \\ because the variable is string-embedded multiple times!
DEFAULT_REGISTRY = C:\\\\CWB\\\\Registry
## Maintainer's note: monitor the success of the above carefully!

## Access permission for installed files (octal code for regular files)
## Windows doesn't support octal permissions. When NTFS disks are mounted in Linux, all
## files appear as having 777 -- so that's what I've gone for here.  
INST_PERM = 777

## static linking supported by the mingw cross-compiler
SITE_CFLAGS =
SITE_LDFLAGS = -static
