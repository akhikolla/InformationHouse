/**
 * @file
 *
 * The CL_Regex object, and the CL Regular Expression Optimiser.
 *
 * This is the CL front-end to POSIX regular expressions with CL semantics
 * (most notably: CL regexes always match the entire string and NOT
 * substrings.)
 *
 * Note that the optimiser is handled automatically by the CL_Regex object.
 *
 * All variables / functions containing "regopt" are internal to this
 * module and are not exported in the CL API.
 *
 * Optimisation is done by means of "grains". The grain array in a CL_Regex
 * object is a list of short strings. Any string which will match the
 * regex must contain at least one of these. Thus, the grains
 * provide a quick way of filtering out strings that definitely WON'T
 * match, and avoiding a time-wasting call to the POSIX regex
 * matching function.
 *
 * While a regex is being optimised, the grains are stored in non-exported
 * global variables in this module. Subsequently they are transferred to
 * members of the CL_regex object with which they are associated.
 * The use of global variables and a fixed-size buffer for
 * grains is partly due to historical reasons,
 * but it does also serve to reduce memory allocation overhead.

 * The regular expression engine used is PCRE. However, the regex is optimized by
 * scanning it for literal strings ("grains") that must be contained in any
 * match; the grains can be used as a fast pre-filter (using Boyer-Moore search
 * for the grains).
 *
 * The optimizer only understands a subset of PCRE syntax:
 *  - literal characters (alphanumeric, safe punctuation, escaped punctuation)
 *  - numeric character codes (\x and \o)
 *  - escape sequences for character classes and Unicode properties
 *  - all repetition operators
 *  - simple alternatives (...|...|...)

 * Any regexp that contains other syntactic elements such as
 *  - character sets [...]
 *  - named groups, look-ahead and look-behind patterns, etc.
 *  - backreferences
 *  - modifiers such as (?i)
 * cannot be parsed and optimized. Note that even if a regexp is parsed by
 * the optimizer, it might not be able to extract all grains (because grain
 * recognition uses an even more restrictive syntax).
 *
 * The optimizer is always disabled with IGNORE_DIAC if either PCRE JIT is

  /**
   * The code below parses a regular expression using the supported PCRE subset
   * and attempts to extract a literal string ("grain") that must occur in every
   * match of the regular expression. In a disjunction group, each alternative
   * must contain a grain in order to be used for optimized matching; we refer to
   * this as a complete grain set.
   *
   * The algorithm scans the regular expression from left to right,
   * looking for the following supported elements in the specified order:
   *
   *  1. a literal grain (read_grain)
   *  2. a parenthesized disjunction containing grains (read_disjunction)
   *  3. a segment matching some, possibly empty substring (read_wildcard),
   *     including recursively nested capturing or non-capturing groups
   *
   * See the respective functions for further information on these elements.
   * Grains are collected by read_grain and read_disjunction in a local buffer.
   * If a complete grain set has been found, it replaces the previous global
   * grain set if it is considered to be more effective based on the length
   * and number of grains.
   *
   * As a special case, the optimizer first attempts to match the entire
   * regexp as a simple disjunction (read_disjunction) without parentheses.
