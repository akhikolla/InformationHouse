Title: Fast Kernel Sums
Version: 0.1.4
Author: David P. Hofmeyr
Maintainer: David P. Hofmeyr <dhofmeyr@sun.ac.za>
Description: Implements the method of Hofmeyr, D.P. (2019) <DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2930501> for fast evaluation of univariate kernel smoothers based on recursive computations.
  Applications to the basic problems of density and regression function estimation are provided, as well as some projection pursuit methods
  for which the objective is based on non-parametric functionals of the projected density, or conditional density of a response given projected
  covariates.
