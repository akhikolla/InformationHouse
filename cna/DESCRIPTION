Description: Provides comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with Coincidence Analysis (CNA), which is a configurational comparative method of causal data analysis that was first introduced in Baumgartner (2009) <doi:10.1177/0049124109339369>, and generalized in Baumgartner & Ambuehl (2018) <doi:10.1017/psrm.2018.45>. CNA is designed to recover INUS-causation from data, which is particularly relevant for analyzing processes featuring conjunctural causation (component causation) and equifinality (alternative causation). CNA is currently the only method for INUS-discovery that allows for multiple effects (outcomes/endogenous factors), meaning it can analyze common-cause and causal chain structures.
