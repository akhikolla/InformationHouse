Changes in version 1.7.3
  * Adding suppressWarnings(RNGversion("3.5.0")) to tests as a result 
    of https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17494.

Changes in version 1.7.2
  * Maintenance updates
  * Remove Makevars files as not required by Rcpp >= 0.11.

Changes in version 1.7.1
  * Tag for the The Journal of Open Source Software paper: 
    http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00748

Changes in version 1.7
  * Moving to Github
  * Roxygen
  * testthat
  * Travis CI
  
Changes in version 1.6.3
  * Avoid two centers being equal (mainly a problem for very few loci)
  * Internal: PedigreeSums added with increased stack size and progress indicator
  
Changes in version 1.6.2
  * Minor technical changes for keeping CRAN checks happy
    
Changes in version 1.6.1
  * Plot functionality for disclapmix was broken for fits with only one 
    subpopulation/cluster.

Changes in version 1.6
  * Plot functionality for disclapmix fit takes an argument for the 
    distances between clusters (defaults to clusterdist(x)). This
    can be used if the distances have been precalculated.
  * Minor technical changes for keeping CRAN checks happy
  
Changes in version 1.5
  * Added AICc (Akaike Information Criterium with finite sample correction)
  * Added plot functionality for a disclapmix fit
  * Corrected number of model observations, leading to corrected BIC values (AIC not affected)
  * Error in full likelihood ratio corrected (not used for model selection)
    
Changes in version 1.4
  * Added separation of two persons mixtures (see example in ?rank_contributor_pairs)
  * Added AIC (Akaike Information Criterium) for a model disclapmixfit

Changes in version 1.3
  * Added simulate from fitted model
  * Added haplotype diversity calculation from a fitted model
  * Added parameter to control number of IRLS iterations (glm_control_maxit)
  * Added parameter to control IRLS convergence (glm_control_eps)
  * Changed default iterations to 100L, glm_control_maxit to 50L and 
    glm_control_eps to 1e-6
  * Fixed error with no IRLS output for verbose = 2L expect for glm.fit
  * Small changes in verbose output
  
Changes in version 1.2
  * Changed default glm_method to internal_coef due to speed considerations
  * Fixed issues when having one cluster, one locus or both

Changes in version 1.1
  * Code changes for OS X, Windows and Solaris compatibility

Changes in version 1.0
  * Totally rewritten such that the algorithm is more memory and CPU 
    efficient and can be used to analyse larger datasets
  * Internal IRLS algorithm implemented, much faster than glm.fit for this
    kind of data. glm.fit is still available. See glm_method in ?disclapmix.
  * NOTE: Updated API

Changes in version 0.4
  * Fixed error when there is no variation in a subpopulation

Changes in version 0.3
  * Fixed error such that verbose = 1 outputs progress information
  * Number of model parameters corrected, which changes marginal and
    full BIC slightly, but only with a constant change meaning that for the 
    same data, the optimal number of centers is the same

Changes in version 0.2
	* disclapmix: verbose more fine grained
	* FIXED: disclapmix: use.parallel = TRUE created problems under Windows
	* Corrected minor documentation errors

Changes in version 0.1
	* Initial release
