Description: Run computer experiments using the adaptive composite grid
    algorithm with a Gaussian process model.
    The algorithm works best when running an experiment that can evaluate thousands
    of points from a deterministic computer simulation.
    This package is an implementation of a forthcoming paper by Plumlee,
    Erickson, Ankenman, et al. For a preprint of the paper,
    contact the maintainer of this package.
