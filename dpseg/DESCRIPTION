Description: Piecewise linear segmentation of ordered data by a
        dynamic programming algorithm. The algorithm was developed for time
	series data, e.g. growth curves, and for genome-wide read-count data
        from next generation sequencing, but is broadly applicable.
        Generic implementations of dynamic programming routines allow
        to scan for optimal segmentation parameters and test custom
        segmentation criteria ("scoring functions").
