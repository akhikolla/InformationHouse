  abstract = {This paper deals with fitting piecewise terms in regression models
where one or more break-points are true parameters of the model.
For estimation, a simple linearization technique is called for,
taking advantage of the linear formulation of the problem. As
a result, the method is suitable for any regression model with
linear predictor and so current software can be used; threshold
modelling as function of explanatory variables is also allowed.
Differences between the other  procedures available are shown
and relative merits discussed. Simulations and two examples are
presented to illustrate the method.}

        abstract = {Piecewise growth mixture models are a flexible and useful class
of methods for analyzing segmented trends in individual growth
trajectory over time, where the individuals come from a mixture
of two or more latent classes. These models allow each segment
of the overall developmental process within each class to have
a different functional form; examples include two linear phases
of growth, or a quadratic phase followed by a linear phase. The
changepoint (knot) is the time of transition from one developmental
phase (segment) to another. Inferring the location of the changepoint(s)
is often of practical interest, along with inference for other
model parameters. A random changepoint allows for individual  differences
in the transition time within each class. The primary objectives
of our study are as follows: (1) to develop a PGMM using a Bayesian
inference approach that allows the estimation of multiple random
changepoints within each class; (2) to develop a procedure to
empirically detect the number of random changepoints within each
class; and (3) to empirically investigate the bias and precision
of the estimation of the model parameters, including the random
changepoints, via a simulation study. We have developed the user-friendly
package BayesianPGMM for R to facilitate the adoption of this
methodology in practice, which is available at \verb+https://github.com/lockEF/BayesianPGMM+
. We describe an application to mouse-tracking data for a visual
recognition task.}

        abstract = {The segmentation of time series and genomic data is a common problem
in computational biology. With increasingly complex measurement
procedures individual data points are often not just numbers or
simple vectors in which all  components are of the same kind.
Analysis methods that capitalize on slopes in a  single real-valued
data track or that make explicit use of the vectorial nature of
the data are not applicable in such scenaria. We develop here
a framework for  segmentation in arbitrary data domains that only
requires a minimal notion of similarity. Using unsupervised clustering
of (a sample of) the input yields an approximate segmentation
algorithm that is efficient enough for genome-wide applications.
As a showcase application we segment a time-series of transcriptome
sequencing data from budding yeast, in high temporal resolution
over ca. 2.5 cycles of the short-period respiratory oscillation.
The algorithm is used with a  similarity measure focussing on
periodic expression profiles across the metabolic cycle rather
than coverage per time point.}
