\title{Random Effects and Sample Selection Models for Panel Counting Data}
\description{
A high performance package for estimating counting models with random effects and sample selection in panel counting data, namely counting data with repeated observations on individuals over time. \cr

ProbitRE: Probit model with random effects on individuals \cr \cr
PoissonRE: Poisson model with random effects on individuals \cr \cr
PLN_RE: Poisson Lognormal model with random effects on individuals \cr \cr
CRE: PoissonRE and ProbitRE model with correlated random effects on individuals \cr \cr
CRE_SS: PLN_RE and ProbitRE model with correlated random effects on individual level and correlated error terms on <individual, time> level \cr \cr
