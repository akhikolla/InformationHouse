}
\arguments{
\item{idsInSet}{A list of set names and their member IDs.}

\item{score}{A vector of addible scores with the same length used to assign input preference;
higher score has larger weight, i.e. -logP.}

A list of \code{clusters} and \code{representatives} for each cluster.
\describe{
 \item{clusters}{A list of character vectors of set IDs in each cluster.}
 \item{representatives}{A character vector of representatives for each cluster.}
