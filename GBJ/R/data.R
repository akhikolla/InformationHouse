#' Genotypes at FGFR2 SNPs for subjects from 'GBR' population in the 1000 Genomes Project.
#'
#' A dataset containing the genotypes (number of minor alleles) for each of 91 subjects
#' from the 'GBR' population in the 1000 Genomes Projects.  There are 64 SNPs documented
#' here, all residing in the FGFR2 gene. CRAN rejects the link for unclear reasons, but
#' the original source is at internationalgenome dot org backslash data.

#' Simulated Principal Components for 'GBR' population in the 1000 Genomes Project.
#'
#' A dataset containing 5 simulated Principal Components (PCs) for each of 91 subjects
#' from the 'GBR' population in the 1000 Genomes Projects.  These would normally be
#' used as covariates in a regression model to control for population stratification.
