Description: Handle genomic data within data frames just as you would with 'GRanges'.
    This packages provides method to deal with genomic intervals the "tidy-way" which makes
    it simpler to integrate in the the general data munging process. The API is inspired by the
    popular 'bedtools' and the genome_join() method from the 'fuzzyjoin' package.
