# ExactMultinom 0.1.2

R-package to compute exact p-values for multinomial goodness-of-fit tests based on multiple test statistics, namely, Pearson's chi-square, the log-likelihood ratio and the probability mass statistic. Implements the algorithm detailed in Resin (2020) <arXiv:2008.12682>. Estimates based on the classical asymptotic chi-square approximation or Monte-Carlo simulation can also be computed.
