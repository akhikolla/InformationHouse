\title{The stochastic degree sequence model (sdsm) for backbone probabilities}
\usage{
sdsm(B, model = "polytope", trials = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{graph: Bipartite graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.}

\item{model}{String: A method used to compute probabilities for generating random bipartite graphs.
Can be c("logit", "probit", "cauchit", "log", "cloglog", "scobit", "oldlogit","lpm", "rcn", "curveball", "polytope").}

\item{trials}{Integer: If ‘model’ = ‘curveball’, number of random bipartite graphs generated using curveball to compute probabilities. Default is 1000.}
}
\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, summary). Here
    `positive` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or above the observed value in the projection,
    `negative` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or below the observed value in the projection, and
    `summary` is a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: model name, number of rows, skew of row sums, number of columns, skew of column sums, and running time.
}
\description{
`sdsm` computes the probability of edge weights being
    above or below the observed edge weights in a bipartite projection
    using the stochastic degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
Specifically, the sdsm function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \code{B*t(B)}
   to the distribution of weights expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite network where
   both the row vertex degrees and column vertex degrees are approximately fixed.

If the 'model' parameter is one of c('logit', 'probit', 'cauchit', 'log', 'cloglog','scobit'),
    then this model is used as a 'link' function for a binary outcome model conditioned on the row degrees and column degrees,
    as described by \link[stats]{glm} and \link[stats]{family}.
    If the 'model' parameter is 'oldlogit', then a logit link function is used but the model is conditioned on the row degrees, column degrees, and their product.
    If 'model = lpm', a linear probability model is used. If 'model = rcn', the probabilities are given by (row degree * column degree)/(total number of edges).

If 'model' = 'curveball' and 'trials' > 0, the probabilities are computed by using \link[backbone]{curveball} function `trials` times. The proportion of each cell being 1 is used as its probability.
    If 'model = polytope', the \link{polytope} function is used to find a matrix of probabilities that maximizes the entropy function, with same row and column sums.

The "backbone" S3 class object returned is composed of two matrices, a summary dataframe and (optionally, if generated by using \link{fdsm}) a 'dyad_values' vector.
