\title{backbone: Extracts the Backbone from Weighted Graphs}
\description{
Provides methods for extracting from a weighted graph
    a binary or signed backbone that retains only the significant edges.
    The user may input a weighted graph, or a bipartite graph
    from which a weighted graph is first constructed via projection.
    Backbone extraction methods include:
    \itemize{
    \item the stochastic degree sequence model (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378873314000343}{Neal, Z. P. (2014). The backbone of bipartite projections: Inferring relationships from co-authorship, co-sponsorship, co-attendance, and other co-behaviors. Social Networks, 39, Elsevier: 84-97.}),
    \item hypergeometric model (\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-013-0107-y}{Neal, Zachary. 2013. “Identifying Statistically Significant Edges in One-Mode Projections.” Social Network Analysis and Mining 3 (4). Springer: 915–24. DOI:10.1007/s13278-013-0107-y.}),
    \item the fixed degree sequence model (\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-011-0021-0}{Zweig, Katharina Anna, and Michael Kaufmann. 2011. “A Systematic Approach to the One-Mode Projection of Bipartite Graphs.” Social Network Analysis and Mining 1 (3): 187–218.}),
    \item  as well as a universal threshold method.
    }

\details{
Some features of the package are:
\itemize{
\item '\code{\link{universal}}': returns a backbone graph in which edge weights
    are set to 1 if above the given upper parameter threshold,
    and set to -1 if below the given lower parameter threshold, and are 0 otherwise.
\item '\code{\link{sdsm}}': computes the probability of edge weights being above or below the observed edge weights in a bipartite projection using the stochastic degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
\item '\code{\link{hyperg}}': computes the probability of edge weights being above or below the observed edge weights in a bipartite projection using the hypergeometric model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
\item '\code{\link{fdsm}}': computes the proportion of edge weights above or below the observed edge weights in a bipartite projection using the fixed degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
\item '\code{\link{backbone.extract}}': returns a backbone graph object that retains only the significant edges.
}

Additional functions that aid in the use of the above models are exported:
\itemize{
\item '\code{\link{polytope}}': finds a matrix that maximizes the entropy function, used in \code{\link{sdsm}}.
\item '\code{\link{curveball}}': generates a random 0/1 matrix with the same row and column sums as the input, used in \code{\link{sdsm}} and \code{\link{fdsm}}.
