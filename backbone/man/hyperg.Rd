\title{Compute hypergeometric backbone probabilities}
\usage{
hyperg(B)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{graph: Bipartite graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.}
}
\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, summary). Here
    `positive` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or above the observed value in the projection,
    `negative` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or below the observed value in the projection, and
    `summary` is a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: model name, number of rows, skew of row sums, number of columns, skew of column sums, and running time.
}
\description{
`hyperg` computes the probability of observing
    a higher or lower edge weight using the hypergeometric distribution.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
Specifically, this function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \eqn{B*t(B)} to the
    distribution of weights expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite graph where
    the row vertex degrees are fixed but the column vertex degrees are allowed to vary.

The "backbone" S3 class object returned is composed of two matrices, a summary dataframe and (optionally, if generated by using \link{fdsm}) a 'dyad_values' vector.
