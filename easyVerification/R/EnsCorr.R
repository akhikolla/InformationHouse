#' Correlation with Ensemble Mean
#' 
#' Computes the ensemble mean correlation (Pearson) with the verifying
#' observations.

#' @param ens n x k matrix of n forecasts from k ensemble members
#' @param obs n verifying observations
#'   
#' @examples
#' tm <- toymodel()
#' 
#' ## compute correlation directly
#' EnsCorr(tm$fcst, tm$obs)
#' 
#' ## compute correlation using veriApply
#' veriApply("EnsCorr", tm$fcst, tm$obs)

#' @seealso \code{\link{veriApply}}
