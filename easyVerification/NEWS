Changes in version 0.4.4
  * Added min-fcst threshold for missing value masking (fraction and absolute number of forecasts)
  * fixed Rcpp dependency problems
  * fixed NA bug with reference forecasts

Changes in version 0.4.3
  * improved missing value handling
  * fixed bug in "EnsRocss"

Changes in version 0.4.2

  * Fixed bug with missing values and na.rm=T in translating to categorical forecasts in `convert2prob`
  * Fixed issue with limited amount of unique values in `convert2prob`

Changes in version 0.4.1

  * Fixed CRAN NOTE on registration of native routines
  * Fixed bug in setting up reference forecasts with missing observations
  * Improved error handling with missing values in forecast
  * Improve performance of `convert2prob` with reduced baseline
  * Added missing value support for `count2prob`
  * Fixed unit test causing episodic errors

Changes in version 0.4.0

  * Adopted to new version of SpecsVerification (0.5.0)
  * Fully implemented out-of-sample computation of percentile thresholds
  * Changed to new implementation of AUC in 'SpecsVerification' with standard errors

Changes in version 0.3.0 (2016-09-28)

  * added support for out-of-sample reference forecasts (user-defined or by keyword for a few standard approaches, issues #1 and #2)
  * added support for difference in scores functions (related to skill scores)
  * removed onload function to check package version. Updating is now dealt with by update.packages as for other CRAN packages.
  * removed non-sensical mean error skill score `EnsMess`.
  * deprecated ill-defined ROC area skill score. In future versions, only the ROC area score will be implemented `EnsRoca`.
  * Added reliability categorization following Weisheimer et al. (2014).
  * fixed bug in `convert2prob` for climatological forecasts (reduced set of values to compute percentile boundaries for consistency).
  * fix for `FairRpss` against climatological reference forecast with category boundaries defined on distribution of verifying observations.

Changes in version 0.2.0 (2016-01-25)

  * Added ignorance score for probability forecasts `EnsIgn` and skill score `EnsIgnss`
  * replaced `EnsRoca` and `rank.ensembles` in `Ens2AFC` with C++ equivalents that are slightly faster
  * added documentation for `veriApply` (issue #4)
  * added multi-model option for relative thresholds to `convert2prob`
  * added support for named vector output in functions such as `Corr` and `CorrDiff` from `SpecsVerification`
  * added bug fix from Henrik Bengtsson (pull request #3)
  * updated documentation also to reflect that package is now available on CRAN
  * minor bugfixes

Changes in version 0.1.8 (2015-10-25)

  * prepared package for release on CRAN

Changes in version 0.1.7.3

  * added support for ensembles of size 1

Changes in version 0.1.7.2

  * fixed documentation
  * added new function to convert counts (from `convert2prob`) to probabilities (`count2prob`)

## easyVerificaiton 0.1.7.1

  * additional arguments for parallel processing courtesy of Matteo De Felice

Changes in version 0.1.7.0

  * added parallelization of `veriApply` using the `parallel` package
  * parallelization is based on FORK nodes, and thus won't work under Windows
  * under Windows and if `parallel` is not available, the original, unparallelized fallback is used
  * parallelization will use up to 16 nodes, but will leave one node free for other tasks

Changes in version 0.1.6.0

  * added `toymodel` to produce forecast-observation pairs
  * added `toyarray` to produce multiple independent forecast-observation pairs, for example at different spatial locations

Changes in version 0.1.5.3

  * Fixed bug in `veriApply` for reformatting output of scores (not affecting skill scores)

Changes in version 0.1.5.2

  * Added ECOMS-UDG / easyVerification vignette

Changes in version 0.1.5.1

  * updated documentation for elementary skill functions

Changes in version 0.1.5

  * probability and absolute thresholds for conversion of continuous forecasts to category forecasts can now be supplied to be forecast specific (e.g. different thresholds for different lead times and spatial locations)
  * bug fix in `veriApply` with minimal forecast, observation examples

Changes in version 0.1.4.2

  * Fixed bug in missing value treatment with `convert2prob`. This will not affect functions called using `veriApply` as of yet as scores in `veriApply` are only computed for complete forecast and observation pairs

Changes in version 0.1.4.1

  * Bug fix (scaling) of standard error provided in `EnsRocss`

Changes in version 0.1.4

  * Support for dressed metrics from `SpecsVerification`. Only the standard dressing method ("silverman") is supported so far.
  * Significance for `EnsRocss`
  * `FairSprErr` Fair spread error ratio
  * `EnsRocss` allow for arbitrary reference forecasts in ROC area skill score (no significance for reference forecasts with ROC area != 0.5)

Changes in version 0.1.3

  * `Ens2AFC` Added the generalized discrimination score for ensembles.

Changes in version 0.1.2

  * Moved repository to new location on github.com.
  * Added vignette documenting the basic functionality of the package.
  * Bugfix for ensembles of size 1.
  * Removed redundant checks on ensemble size.
