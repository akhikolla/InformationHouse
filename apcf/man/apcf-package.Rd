\title{Adapted Pair Correlation Function}
\description{
A faster implementation of the adapted Pair Correlation Function presented
in Nuske et al. (2009) in C++ using the libraries GEOS and GDAL directly
instead of through PostGIS.
}
\details{
The Adapted Pair Correlation Function transfers the concept of the Pair
Correlation Function from point patterns to patterns of patches of finite
size and irregular shape (eg. lakes within a country). The main tasks are
(i) the construction of nullmodels by rondomizing the patches of the
original pattern within the study area, (ii) the edge correction by
determining the proportion of a buffer within the study area, and
(iii) the calculation of the shortest distances between the patches.

This package mainly provides three functions:
\itemize{
\item create null models and calculate distances and ratios,
\item turn distances and ratios into an edge corrected PCF, and
\item plot Pair Correlation Functions.
}
}
\section{Pattern to Distances & Ratios}{

The task consistes of two parts: creating null models / permutations and
calculating distances between all objects of a pattern and determining
the fraction of the perimeter a buffer inside the study area.
Permutations of the original pattern are achieved by randomly rotating
and randomly placing all objects within the study area without overlap.

The resulting collection of distances and ratios of each null model and the
original pattern are returned as an object of class \link{dists} (a data.frame
with some additional attributes).

The library GEOS (>= 3.4.0) is used for the geometrical analysis of the pattern.
Geodata are converted to GEOS Geometries with the help of GDAL/OGR (>= 2.0.1).
The GEOS functions are called from C++ Functions which are integrated into
R via Rcpp and wrapped in the R function \code{\link[=pat2dists]{pat2dists()}}.
}

\section{Create an edge corrected PCF}{

The \link{dists} objects are turned into \link{fv_pcf} objects by the function \code{\link[=dists2pcf]{dists2pcf()}}.
A C++ function finds all distances and ratios belonging to a null model or
the original pattern (marked with index 0) and calculates a density function
using the Epanechnikov kernel and Ripley's edge correction. Resulting in as
many PCFs as null models were created plus a PCF for the original pattern.
From the PCF of the null models a pointwise critical envelope is derived.
The arithmetic mean of all PCF of the null models is employed for a bias
correction of the emperical PCF and the upper and lower bound of the envelope.
}

\section{Plot a PCF}{

\code{\link[=plot.fv_pcf]{plot.fv_pcf()}} is an S3 method of the plot function for the class \link{fv_pcf}.
It provides a nice plot of the emperical PCF together with the pointwise
critical envelope.
