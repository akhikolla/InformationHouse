\title{Model attraction or repulsion between all particles in the system}
\description{
This force implements a n-body simulation using the Barnes-Hut approximation
for improved performance. An n-body simulation calculates attraction or
repulsion between all particles in a system based on their relative distances
and each particles capacity and can thus mimick gravity or electrostatic
repulsion.
}
\section{Training parameters}{

The following parameters defines the training of the force and can be passed
along a call to \code{\link[=wield]{wield()}}
\itemize{
\item \code{strength} : The attractive or repulsive force of the particles. If
positive the particle attracts, if negative the particle repulses. The
default is -30. (\emph{tidy eval})
\item \code{theta} : The Barnes-Hut criterion governing the precision of the
approximation. If 0, no approximation is made. Defaults to 0.9.
\item \code{min_dist} : A lower distance threshold below which the forces will be
damped, in order to avoid explosive forces when two particles gets very
near each other.
\item \code{max_dist} : A distance threshold above which the forces between particles
are ignored. Using this will result in more local changes.
