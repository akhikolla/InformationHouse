\title{Models particles as circles with a given radius and pushes overlapping particles apart}
\description{
This force pushes overlapping particles apart by assigning a radius to each
particle, treating them as circles, and searches for overlaps through an
optimised quad tree algorithm.
}
\section{Training parameters}{

The following parameters defines the training of the force and can be passed
along a call to \code{\link[=wield]{wield()}}
\itemize{
\item \code{strength} : A dampening of the repulsion between overlapping circles. This
allows the force to iterate towards the optimal solution through iterative
relaxation. Should be a number between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.7
\item \code{radius} : The radius of each particle. Defaults to 1 (\emph{tidy eval})
\item \code{n_iter} : The number of iterations to perform in the iterative relaxation.
Defaults to 1.
