#' Assign a force or constraint to a simulation
#'
#' This function adds a new force/constraint to the simulation and trains the it
#' on the current particle graph. The parameters passed on to the training are
#' using tidy evaluation from the rlang package. Depending on the
#' force/constraint the data getting referenced is either the node or the edge
#' data of the particle graph. Both forces and constraints manipulate position
#' and velocity of the particles but they differ in when the are applied during
#' a generation. First forces are applied sequentially and the resulting
#' velocity is added to the resulting position after `velocity_decay` has been
#' applied. After this operation any constraint is imposed on the results. In
#' general, forces tends to calculate velocity adjustments, while constraints
#' modify position and velocity directly, but this difference is not in any way
#' enforced.
#'
#' @details
#' `wield()` and `impose()` adds forces and constraints to the simulation
#' respectively. `unwield()` and `unimpose()` removes forces and constraints
#' based on name or index. `rewield()` and `reimpose()` modifies existing forces
#' and constraints based on name or index and retrains them.
#'
#' @param simulation A simulation object
#'
#' @param force A force object
#'
#' @param ... Parameters passed on to the training of the force or constraint
#'
#' @param name The name of the force. For use when accessing the force at a
#' later stage. If no name is given the force is accessible by its index in the
#' stack.
#'
#' @param include The particles to be affected by this force. Defaults to every
#' particle in the simulation (*tidy eval*)
#'
#' @return A simulation with the force or constraint added
