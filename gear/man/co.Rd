\description{
These data were collected by the United
  States Geological Survey (USGS).  Their description is
  as follows:  In 2006, soil samples were collected at
  960 sites (1 site per 280 square kilometers) throughout
  the state of Colorado. These samples were collected
  from a depth of 0 to 15 centimeters and, following a
  near-total multi-acid digestion, were analyzed for a
  suite of more than 40 major and trace elements. The
  resulting data set provides a baseline for the natural
  variation in soil geochemistry for Colorado and forms
  the basis for detecting changes in soil composition
  that might result from natural processes or
  anthropogenic activities.

Latitude and Longitude determined by hand-held GPS
instrument using WGS84 datum.  The longitude and latitude
coordinates were converted to UTM coordinates using the
following commands:

\code{library(sp)}

\code{lonlat = co[, c("longitude", "latitude")]}

\code{coordinates(lonlat) = c("longitude", "latitude")}

\code{proj4string(lonlat) = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")}

\code{xy = spTransform(lonlat, CRS("+proj=utm +zone=13 ellps=WGS84"))}
}
