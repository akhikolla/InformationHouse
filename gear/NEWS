# 0.1.5 Change tests to safely handle orphaned package geoR.
# 0.2.0 Update tests to not require spam, geoR, gstat
        packages. Replace vgram with evgram to avoid
        conflict with fields package. Replace mle with
        estimate to avoid conflicts with spam package. Add
        ability to model geometric anisotropy with cmod_std.
        Plan deprecation of vgram, cmod.std, cmod.man,
        longlat argument in geolm. Fix bug in reml loglik
        calculations. Add many new tests. Save test results
        when possible for faster testing.
# 0.3.0 Update package so that sp, ggplot2, lattice packages
        are only suggested and not imported. Add geodist
        function to replace sp::spDists. Improve return of
        predict.geolm* so that coordinates of returned
        object match coordinates originally specified by
        geolm. Create geardf class for easy plotting with
        plotting mechanism via autoimage::autopoints and
        autoimage::autoimage. Replace gearPredict return
        with geardf.
