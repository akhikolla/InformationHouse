
## Installing software

You'll want to install:

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Getting the files

Then you'll want your own copy of the files.

- Create an account with [GitHub](https://github.com/join)
- _Fork_ the [Quartet](https://github.com/ms609/Quartet) repository by clicking
  the "Fork" button at the top-right of its page
- Run Github Desktop and log in.  Head to _File→Clone repository_ (Shift-Ctrl-O).
  The fork you just made should appear in the GitHub.com tab.
  Specify the Local path to which you wish to save the files.
  
## Exploring

Now open RStudio and create a _File→New project_ from an existing directory,
using the Quartet folder that you just created.  In RStudio, navigate to 
`data-raw/Congreve2016.Rmd`.  You can run one code chunk at a time by clicking 
their green "play" arrows, or one line at a time by keying _Ctrl-Enter_ whilst
the cursor is on that line.  See whether you can understand what is happening.

## Editing

Once you've got a handle on the code, you can try editing it.  
Make a small change to a file, and save it.  
Github Desktop should notice this change, and allow you to commit it to GitHub.
Type in a descriptive summary, and a description of the changes if you want, then
use the `Commit` button to register the changes on your machine.  
Use the "Push" button (on the black toolbar) to push your local changes to the 
GitHub server.  These are now stored "in the cloud", meaning that they are
backed up and available for you to access wherever you are.
