\title{Compute explained variances from loadings}
\usage{
.compute_vars(L_unrot, L_rot, Phi = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{L_unrot}{matrix. Unrotated factor loadings.}

\item{L_rot}{matrix. Rotated factor loadings.}

\item{Phi}{matrix. Factor intercorrelations. Provide only if oblique rotation
is used.}
}
\value{
A matrix with sum of squared loadings, proportion explained variance
 from total variance per factor, same as previous but cumulative, Proportion
 of explained variance from total explained variance, and same as previous but
 cumulative.
}
\description{
From unrotated loadings compute the communalities and uniquenesses for total
variance. Compute explained variances per factor from rotated loadings (and
factor intercorrelations Phi if oblique rotation was used).
