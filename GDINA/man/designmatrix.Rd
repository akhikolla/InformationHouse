\title{Generate design matrix}
\usage{
designmatrix(Kj = NULL, model = "GDINA", Qj = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Kj}{Required except for the MS-DINA model; The number of attributes required for item j}

\item{model}{the model associated with the design matrix; It can be "GDINA","DINA","DINO", "ACDM" or "MSDINA".
The default is "GDINA". Note that models "LLM" and "RRUM" have the same design matrix as the ACDM.}

\item{Qj}{the Q-matrix for item j; This is required for "MSDINA" model; The number of rows is equal to the number
of strategies and the number of columns is equal to the number of attributes.}
}
\value{
a design matrix (Mj). See de la Torre (2011) for details.
}
\description{
This function generates the design matrix for an item
