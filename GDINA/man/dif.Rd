\arguments{
\item{dat}{item responses from two groups; missing data need to be coded as \code{NA}}

\item{Q}{Q-matrix specifying the association between items and attributes}

\item{group}{a numerical vector with integer 1, 2, ..., # of groups indicating the group each individual belongs to. It must start from 1 and its
length must be equal to the number of individuals.}

\item{model}{model for each item.}

\item{method}{DIF detection method; It can be \code{"wald"} for Hou, de la Torre, and Nandakumar's (2014)
Wald test method, and \code{"LR"} for likelihood ratio test (Ma, Terzi, Lee,& de la Torre, 2017).}

\item{anchor.items}{which items will be used as anchors? Default is \code{NULL}, which means none of the items are used as anchors.
For LR method, it can also be an integer vector giving the item numbers for anchors or \code{"all"}, which means all items are treated as anchor items.}

\item{dif.items}{which items are subject to DIF detection? Default is \code{"all"}. It can also be an integer vector giving the item numbers.}

\item{p.adjust.methods}{adjusted p-values for multiple hypothesis tests. This is conducted using \code{p.adjust} function in \pkg{stats},
and therefore all adjustment methods supported by \code{p.adjust} can be used, including \code{"holm"},
\code{"hochberg"}, \code{"hommel"}, \code{"bonferroni"}, \code{"BH"} and \code{"BY"}. See \code{p.adjust}
for more details. \code{"holm"} is the default.}

\item{approx}{Whether an approximated LR test is implemented? If TRUE, parameters of items except the studied one will not be re-estimated.}

\item{SE.type}{Type of standard error estimation methods for the Wald test.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to GDINA function for model calibration}

\item{object}{dif object for S3 method}
}
\value{
A data frame giving the Wald statistics and associated p-values.
}
\description{
This function is used to detect differential item functioning based on the models estimated
in the \code{\link{GDINA}} function using the Wald test (Hou, de la Torre, & Nandakumar, 2014) and the likelihood ratio
test (Ma, Terzi, Lee, & de la Torre, 2017). It can only detect DIF for two groups currently.
