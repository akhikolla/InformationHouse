#' @title Dutch Cars Data
#' @description This data set relates to 187 Dutch households rating 10 automobile manufacturers according 
#' to 8 variables (original Dutch terms in parentheses): price (prijsniveau), design (vormgeving), safety (veiligheid), operating cost (gebruikskosten), )
#' sportiness (sportiviteit), size (modelgrootte), reliability (betrouwbaarheid) and feautures (uitrusting). 
#' A rating scale from 1 to 10 was used. 
#' @details The original sample consisted of 188 households. However, one of these households (code 87845) was discarded 
#' because it appears that they used a rating scale from 0 to 10 instead of from 1 to 10. Note that all rating scales has
#' been reversed so that higher scores are better for most items. The exceptions are OperatingCost and Size, where larger
#' values mean higher costs and smaller cars respectively.
