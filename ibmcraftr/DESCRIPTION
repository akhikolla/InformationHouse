Description: It provides a generic set of tools for initializing a synthetic
         population with each individual in specific disease states, and
         making transitions between those disease states according to the rates
         calculated on each timestep. The new version 1.0.0 has C++ code 
         integration to make the functions run faster. It has also a higher level
         function to actually run the transitions for the number of timesteps
         that users specify. Additional functions will follow for changing
         attributes on demographic, health belief and movement.
