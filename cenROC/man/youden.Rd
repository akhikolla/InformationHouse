\title{Computes optimal cutoff point using the Youden index criteria}
\usage{
youden(est, plot = "FALSE")
}
\arguments{
\item{est}{The object returned either by \code{cenROC} or \code{IntROC}.}

\item{plot}{The logical parameter to see the ROC curve plot along with the Youden inex. The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
This function computes the optimal cutoff point using the Youden index criteria of both right and interval censored time-to-event data.
              The Youden index estimator can be either empirical (non-smoothed) or smoothed with/without boundary correction.
}
\details{
In medical decision-making, obtaining the optimal cutoff value is crucial to identify subject at high risk
 of experiencing the event of interest.  Therefore, it is necessary to select a marker value that classifies subjects into
 healthy and diseased groups. To this end, in the literature, several methods for selecting optimal cutoff point have been
 proposed. In this package, we only included the Youden index criteria.
