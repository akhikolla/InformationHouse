Description: Calculate the win ratio for prioritized outcomes and the 95% confidence interval based on Bebu and Lachin (2016) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv032>. Three type of outcomes can be analyzed: survival "failure-time" events, repeated survival "failure-time" events and continuous or ordinal "non-failure time" events that are captured at specific time-points in the study.
