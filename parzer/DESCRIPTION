Title: Parse Messy Geographic Coordinates
Description: Parse geographic coordinates from various formats
    to decimal degree numeric values. Parse coordinates into
    their parts (degree, minutes, seconds); calculate hemisphere
    from coordinates; pull out individually degrees,
    minutes, or seconds; add and subtract degrees, minutes,
    and seconds. C++ code herein originally inspired from code
    written by Jeffrey D. Bogan, but then completely re-written.
