\title{A list consisting of Training and Test data along with corresponding class labels.}
\format{A list consisting of:
\describe{
  \item{TrainData}{ (179 x 4) Matrix of training data features. the first two features satisfy sqrt(x_{i1}^2 + x_{i2}^2) > 2/3 if the ith sample is in class 1. 
Otherwise, they satisfy sqrt(x_{i1}^2 + x_{i2}^2) < 2/3 - 1/10 if the ith sample is in class 2. 
The third and fourth features are generated as independent N(0, 1/2) noise.}
  \item{TestData}{ (94 x 4) Matrix of test data features. the first two features satisfy sqrt(x_{i1}^2 + x_{i2}^2) > 2/3 if the ith sample is in class 1. 
Otherwise, they satisfy sqrt(x_{i1}^2 + x_{i2}^2) < 2/3 - 1/10 if the ith sample is in class 2. 
The third and fourth features are generated as independent N(0, 1/2) noise.}
