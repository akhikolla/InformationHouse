\title{extract the required elements from the covariance matrix}
\usage{
getMatCov(V, covariances, factor = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{the object returned by vecchia_specify}

\item{covariances}{The full covariance matrix or a covariance function}

\item{factor}{True if we are passing a factor of a matrix}
}
\value{
matrix of size n x (m+1) with only those elements that 
are used by the incomplete Cholesky decomposition
}
\description{
This function takes the entire covariance matrix and creates
a matrix of covariances based on the vecchia approximatino object
}
