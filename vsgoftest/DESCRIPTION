Description: An implementation of Vasicek and Song goodness-of-fit tests. Several functions are provided to estimate differential Shannon entropy, i.e., estimate Shannon entropy of real random variables with density, and test the goodness-of-fit of some family of distributions, including uniform, Gaussian, log-normal, exponential, gamma, Weibull, Pareto, Fisher, Laplace and beta distributions; see Lequesne and Regnault (2020) <doi:10.18637/jss.v096.c01>.
