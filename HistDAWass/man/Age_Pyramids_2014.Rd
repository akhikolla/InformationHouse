hisogram-valued variables, the 5-years age (relative frequencies) distribution of all the population, 
of the male and of the female population of 228 countries of the World. The  first row is the World data.
Thus it contains 229 rows(228 countries plus the World) and 3 variables: "Both.Sexes.Population",
