\title{Merge multiple transactions with the same time stamp}
\usage{
mergeTradesSameTimestamp(tData, selection = "median")
}
\arguments{
\item{tData}{an xts object containing the time series data, with 
one column named "PRICE" indicating the transaction price 
and one column "SIZE" indicating the number of shares traded.}

\item{selection}{indicates how the price for a certain time stamp
should be calculated in case of multiple observation for a certain time
stamp. By default, selection = "median", and the median price is taken. Alternatively:
\itemize{
\item selection = "max.volume": use the price of the transaction with
largest volume.
\item selection = "weighted.average": take the weighted average of all prices.
}}
}
\value{
data.table or xts object depending on input
}
\description{
Function replaces multiple transactions that have the same time stamp by a single one and returns an xts or data.table object with unique time stamps only.
}
\note{
previously this function returned the mean of the size of the merged trades (pre version 0.7 and when not using max.volume as the criterion), now it returns the sum.
