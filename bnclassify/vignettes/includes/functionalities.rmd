# Functionalities 
\label{sec:functionalities}
The package has four groups of functionalities: 

1. Learning network structure and parameters
1. Analyzing the model
1. Evaluating the model 
1. Predicting with the model

\noindent Learning is split into two separate steps, the first being structure learning and the second, optional, parameter learning. The obtained models can be evaluated, used for prediction or analyzed. The following provides a brief overview of this workflow. For details on some of the underlying methods please see the \tecvin/. 

## Structures
The learning algorithms produce the following network structures: 

- Naive Bayes (NB) (Figure \ref{fig:nb}) \citep{Minsky1961}
- One-dependence estimators (ODE) 
    - Tree-augmented naive Bayes (TAN) (Figure \ref{fig:tan}) \citep{Friedman1997}
    - Forest-augmented naive Bayes (FAN) (Figure \ref{fig:fan})
- k-dependence Bayesian classifier (k-DB) \citep{Sahami1996,pernkopf10}
- Semi-naive Bayes (SNB)(Figure \ref{fig:semi}) \citep{Pazzani1996}
- Averaged one-dependence estimators (AODE) \citep{Webb2005} 

\rfig{structures} shows some of these structures and their factorizations of \pcx/. We use k-DB in the sense meant by \cite{pernkopf10} rather than that by \cite{Sahami1996}, as we impose no minimum on the number of augmenting arcs. SNB is the only structure whose complexity is not *a priori* bounded: the feature subgraph might be complete in the extreme case.

\caption{Augmented naive Bayes models produced by the \pkg{bnclassify} package. (a) NB; (b) TAN (c) FAN (d) SNB. k-DB and AODE not shown. The NB assumes that the features are independent given the class. ODE allows each predictor to depend on at most one other predictor: the TAN is a special case with exactly \(n-1\) augmenting arcs (i.e., inter-feature arcs) while a FAN may have less than \(n-1\). The k-DB allows for up to $k$ parent features per feature $X_i$, with NB and ODE as its special cases with $k = 0$ and $k = 1$, respectively. The SNB does not restrict the number of parents but requires that connected feature subgraphs be complete (connected, after removing $C$, subgraphs in (d): $\{X_1, X_2\}$, and $\{X_4,X_5,X_6\}$), also allowing the removal of features (\(X_3\) omitted in (d)). The AODE is not a single structure but an ensemble of $n$ ODE models in which one feature is the parent of all others (a super-parent). }

## Algorithms
Each structure learning algorithm is implemented by a single R function. \rtbl{algorithms} lists these algorithms along with the corresponding structures that they produce, the scores they can be combined with, and their R functions. Below we provide their abbreviations, references, brief comments and illustrate function calls. 

### Fixed structure 
We implement two algorithms: 

- NB 
- AODE 

The NB and AODE structures are fixed given the number of variables, and thus no search is required to estimate them from data. For example, we can get a NB structure with <!-- Conversely, there are no parameters required by the nb and aode function for learning the structure. --> 
\begin{example}
n <- nb('class', dataset = car)
\end{example} 

\noindent where \code{class} is the name of the class variable $C$ and \code{car} the dataset containing observations of $C$ and \X/.

### Optimal ODEs with decomposable scores 
We implement one algorithm:

- Chow-Liu for ODEs  (CL-ODE; \cite{Friedman1997}) 

Maximizing log-likelihood will always produce a TAN while maximizing penalized log-likelihood may produce a FAN since including some arcs can degrade such a score. With incomplete data our implementation does not guarantee the optimal ODE as that would require computing maximum likelihood parameters. The arguments of the \code{tan\_cl()} function are the network score to use and, optionally, the root for features' subgraph: 

```{=latex}
\begin{example} 
n <- tan_cl('class', car, score = 'AIC', root = 'buying') 
\end{example} 
```

### Greedy hill-climbing with global scores

The \pkg{bnclassify} package implements five algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Hill-climbing tree augmented naive Bayes (HC-TAN)
  \citep{Keogh2002}
\item
  Hill-climbing super-parent tree augmented naive Bayes (HC-SP-TAN)
  \citep{Keogh2002}

\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Backward sequential elimination and joining (BSEJ)
  \citep{Pazzani1996}
\item
  Forward sequential selection and joining (FSSJ)
  \citep{Pazzani1996}

\item
  Hill-climbing k-dependence Bayesian classifier (k-DB)
\end{itemize} 

These algorithms use the cross-validated estimate of predictive accuracy as a score. Only the FSSJ and BSEJ perform feature selection. The arguments of the corresponding functions include the number of cross-validation folds \code{k} and the minimal absolute score improvement \code{epsilon} required for continuing the search: 

\begin{example} 
fssj <- fssj('class', car, k = 5, epsilon = 0) 
\end{example} 

\input{algorithms}

## Parameters 
\label{sec:params}
The \pkg{bnclassify} package only handles discrete features. With fully observed data, it estimates the parameters with maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation, according to Equation \ref{eq:disparams}, with a single \(\alpha\) for all local distributions. With incomplete data it uses \emph{available case analysis} and substitutes \(N_{\cdot j \cdot}\) in \req{disparams} with \(N_{i j \cdot} = \sum_{k = 1}^{r_i} N_{i j k}\), i.e., with the count of instances in which \(\mathbf{Pa}(X_i) = j\) and \(X_i\) is observed. 

We implement two methods for weighted naive Bayes parameter estimation: 

- Weighting attributes to alleviate naive Bayesâ€™ independence assumption (WANBIA) \citep{Zaidi2013}
- Attribute-weighted naive Bayes (AWNB)  \citep{Hall2007} 

And one method for estimation by means of Bayesian model averaging over all NB structures with up to $n$ features:

- Model averaged naive Bayes (MANB) \citep{Dash2002}

It makes little sense to apply WANBIA, MANB and AWNB to structures other than NB. WANBIA, for example, learns the weights by optimizing the conditional log-likelihood of the NB. Parameter learning is done with the \code{lp()} function. For example,

```{=latex}
\begin{example}
a <- lp(n, smooth = 1, manb_prior = 0.5) 
\end{example} 
```

\noindent computes Bayesian parameter estimates with \(\alpha = 1\) (the \code{smooth} argument) for all local distributions, and updates them with the MANB estimation obtained with a 0.5 prior probability for each class-to-feature arc.  

## Utilities 
Single-structure-learning functions, as opposed to those that learn an ensemble of structures, return an S3 object of class \code{"bnc\_dag"}. The following functions can be invoked on such objects:

- Plot the network: \code{plot()}
- Query model type: \code{is\_tan()}, \code{is\_ode()}, \code{is\_nb()}, \code{is\_aode()}, ...
- Query model properties: \code{narcs()}, \code{families()}, \code{features()}, ... 
- Convert to a \CRANpkg{gRain} object: \code{as\_grain()} 

Ensembles are of type \code{"bnc\_aode"} and only \code{print()} and model type queries can be applied to such objects. Fitting the parameters (by calling \code{lp()}) of a \code{"bnc\_dag"} produces a \code{"bnc\_bn"} object. In addition to all \code{"bnc\_dag"} functions, the following are meaningful:

- Predict class labels and class posterior probability: \code{predict()}
- Predict joint distribution: \code{compute\_joint()} 
- Network scores: \code{AIC(),BIC(),logLik(),clogLik()} 
- Cross-validated accuracy: \code{cv()}
- Query model properties: \code{nparams()}
- Parameter weights: \code{manb\_arc\_posterior()}, \code{weights()}  

The above functions for \code{"bnc\_bn"} can also be applied to an ensemble with fitted parameters.
