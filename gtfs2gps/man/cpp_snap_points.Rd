\title{Snap points to the closest points from another set}
\usage{
cpp_snap_points(data, ref, spatial_resolution, id)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A set of points to be snapped (a matrix). The result will have
the same number of rows of this argument. Each row will return the respective
snapped point.}

\item{ref}{A set of reference points (another matrix). The result will be 
a subset of this parameter.}

\item{spatial_resolution}{The spatial resolution of data, which means that from each
point of data it is possible to reach at least one point within data with distance 
equals or less than spatial_resolution.}

\item{id}{The id of the data to be shown in case of an error when a given point is
more than [spatial_resolution ^ 4] meters away from the reference matrix.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the snapped points.
}
\description{
Snap a set of points to the closest points available in another set
of points.
