## Non-personalized Recommendation in rrecsys

The included baseline recommendation methods are the global mean rating (Global Average), itemâ€™s mean rating (Item Average), user's mean rating (User Average), as well as an the Most Popular Item Recommendation method that recommends to all users the items that are most popular. 

<!--The "Most Mopular Item Recommendation" algorithm is the simplest implementation for item recommendations.
Every item will be ordered based on the number of times that it has been rated positively. 
A recommendation for a user will be the list of most popular items in the data set that the user has not chosen yet. -->

To train a model for the rating prediction task we use the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data("ml100k")
d <- defineData(ml100k)
e <- evalModel(d, folds = 2)

globAv <- evalPred(e, alg = "globalaverage")
globAv

# Algorithm names might be matched on the registry partially.
itemAv <- evalPred(e,  "itemAver")
itemAv
userAv <- evalPred(e,  "useraverage")
userAv
```
Please notice that the baseline recommenders do not require any other argument.

The returned object are of type _algAverageClass_.
