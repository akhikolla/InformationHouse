at the University of Minnesota.
 
This data set consists of:
\enumerate{
	\item 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	\item Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
}

The data was collected through the MovieLens web site
(movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 
1997 through April 22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users
who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic
