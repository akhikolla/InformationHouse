Title: Fitting Frailty Models with the EM Algorithm
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Theodor Adrian Balan, Hein Putter
Maintainer: Theodor Adrian Balan <hello@tbalan.com>

BugReports: https://github.com/tbalan/frailtyEM/issues
Description: Contains functions for fitting shared frailty models with a semi-parametric
    baseline hazard with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Supported data formats 
    include clustered failures with left truncation and recurrent events in gap-time
    or Andersen-Gill format. Several frailty distributions, such as the the gamma, positive stable
    and the Power Variance Family are supported.
