  * dataObj-methods for covWt() and corWt()
  * dataObj-methods for meanWt() and varWt()
  * method addWeights<- to modify sampling weights based on output from calibSample()
  * dataObj-method for quantileWt()
  * updated default parameters for calibPop(). Previous choices for starting temperature were much to high and too many worse solution were accepted.
  * fixed example for calibPop()
  * new accessor/set functions sampleData, sampleObj, sampleObj<-, popData, popObj, popObj<-, tableObj with updated man-page

Changes in simPop version 0.1.8
  * remove S3-class spBwplot() -> only default method was implemented. Removed option to supply a list of populations; rewritten to use 'simPopObj'-objects

  * fixed man files for spBwplot() and spBwplotStats()

  * updated calibPop() so that the function uses and returns objects of class 'simPopObj'

  * auxData()-methods to query/set 'sample' slot in 'simPopObj'-objects

Changes in simPop version 0.1.7

  * refactorization of calibPop.R to allow parallel computing

Changes in simPop version 0.1.6
  * removed method 'ctree' from simCategorical() -> perhaps add it later

  * removed argument 'basic' from simCategorical(). The function now uses variables listed in slot @basicHHvars of the input object of class 'simPopObj'.

  * made check that slot basicHHvars after simStructure() contains at least one variable.

  * new utility-function manageSynthPopObj() to get/set variables in objects of class 'simPopObj'
  * updated a lot of Rd-Files with (now) working examples

  * updated simEUSILC()

  * various fixes and improvements such as a new c++ implementation of calibVars()

  * cleanup dependencies in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE

  * remove method 'liblinear' from simCategorical() - has never really worked

Changes in simPop version 0.1.3
  * parallelize simRelevation() on non-windows platforms

  * c++ algorithm for simulated annealing in calibPop()

  * multiple commits to fix documentation and cran-notes/warnings when checking

Changes in simPop version 0.1.2
  * temporarily add explicit parallel-option to calibPop() for testing-purposes

  * more efficient implementation of auxiliary-function resample() used in calibPop()

  * changed default setting for auxiliary-variable 'factor' in calibPop() which now allows the algorithm to terminate in an accceptable time

  * added R/zzz.R to get current package version on loading the package

Changes in simPop version 0.1.1
  * more efficient c++ implementation of iterative proportional updating

  * multiple imports from package simPopulation
