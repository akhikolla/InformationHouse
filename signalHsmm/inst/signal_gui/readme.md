## Readme  
  
**signalHsmm** predicts presence of signal peptides in eukaryotic proteins using hidden semi-Markov model. [Visit project homepage on git](http://github.com/michbur/signalHsmm).  
[signalHsmm is also avaible on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/signalHsmm).

### Usage
You may paste sequences directly into the field on right or use **Submit .fasta or .txt file:** button to directly submit a file. The FASTA format is advised.  
Queries bigger than 300 sequences will not be processed. Use the batch mode instead.  
Be patient - calculations can take up to few minutes.  

### Warning

The exact prediction of the regional structure of signal peptides (including position of the cleavage site) is still an experimental feature and should be used with caution.
