Description: The social network literature features numerous methods for assigning
    value to paths as a function of their ties. 'gretel' systemizes these approaches,
    casting them as instances of a generalized path value function indexed by 
    a penalty parameter. The package also calculates probabilistic path value and
    identifies optimal paths in either value framework. Finally, proximity 
    matrices can be generated in these frameworks that capture high-order connections 
    overlooked in primitive adjacency sociomatrices. Novel methods are described
    in Buch (2019) <https://davidbuch.github.io/analyzing-networks-with-gretel.html>. 
    More traditional methods are also implemented, as described in Yang, Knoke (2001) 
    <doi:10.1016/S0378-8733(01)00043-0>.
