\title{Stopover mass calculator}
\usage{
stopover.mass.calculator(bodyMass, fatMass, taxon, duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{bodyMass}{left-over after running function migrate}

\item{fatMass}{left-over after running function migrate}

\item{taxon}{(or order) classified into two categories (passerines and non-passerines)}

\item{duration}{number of hours spent at stop-over site. This must be an integer see example}
}
\value{
fat_mass, body_mass
}
\description{
During stop-overs birds replenish fat mass. Using simplifications
              from Lindstr√∂m 1991. The implementation here is simplistic in that
              muscle mass is not restored as theory and field experiments have
              shown.
