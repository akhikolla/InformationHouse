# FlyingR 0.2

* Name change from flying to FlyingR

* Shortfall in minimum energy from protein, in "csp" and "csw", is now met by adjusting the airframe mass. Previously the entire minimum was drawn from the
airframe mass, which is wrong. So now "csp" and "csw" account for 2% - 3% of the 
total energy and the remainder is met from adjusting airframe mass.

* Simulations run faster

* Stop over mass calculator function (though it doesn't account for 
protein intake).
