\arguments{
\item{classImage}{high resolution RasterLayer containing a landcover classification, e.g. as obtained by \link{superClass}.}

\item{predImage}{coarse resolution RasterLayer for which fractional cover will be estimated.}

\item{nSamples}{Integer. Number of pixels to sample from predImage to train the regression model}

\item{classes}{Integer. Classes for which fractional cover should be estimated (one or more).}

\item{model}{Character. Which model to fit for image regression. See \link[caret]{train} for options. Defaults to randomForest ('rf')}

\item{tuneLength}{Integer. Number of levels for each tuning parameters that should be generated by train. See Details and \code{\link[caret]{train}}.}

\item{method}{Character. Resampling method for parameter tuning. Defaults to 10 fold cross-validation. See \code{\link[caret]{trainControl}} for options.}

\item{maxNA}{Numeric. Maximal proportion of NAs allowed in training pixels.}

\item{clamp}{Logical. Enforce results to stay within [0,1] interval. Values <0 are reset to 0 and values >1 to 1.}

\description{
fCover takes a classified high resolution image, e.g. vegetation and non-vegetation based on Landsat and calculates cover fractions for
pixels of a coarser resolution, e.g. MODIS.
}
\details{
fCover gets the pixel values in a high resolution classified image that correspond to 
randomly selected moderate resolution pixels and then calculates the percent of 
the classified image pixels that represent your cover type of interest. In other words, if 
your high resolution image has a pixel size of 1m and your moderate resolution image has a 
pixel size of 30m the sampling process would take a block of 900 of the 1m resolution pixels 
that correspond to a single 30m pixel and calculate the percentage of the 1m pixels that 
are forest. For example, if there were 600 forest pixels and 300 non-forest pixels the value 
given for the output pixel would be 0.67 since 67% of the block of 1m pixels were forest. 

fCover relies on the train() function from the caret package which provides access to a huge number of classifiers.
Please see the available options at \link[caret]{train}. The default classifier (randomForest) we chose has been shown
to provide very good results in image regression and hence it is recomended you start with this one. If you choose a different
classifier, make sure it can run in regression mode.

Many models require tuning of certain parameters. Again, this is handled by \link[caret]{train} from the caret package.
With the tuneLength argument you can specify how many different values of each tuning parameter should be tested. The Random Forest
algorithm for example can be tuned by varying the mtry parameter. Hence, by specifying tuneLength = 10, ten different levels
of mtry will be tested in a cross-validation scheme and the best-performing value will be chosen for the final model.

If you register a parallel backend before, model fitting will run in parallel.

If the total no-data values for a block of high resolution pixels is greater than maxNA then 
it will not be included in the training data set since there is too much missing data to provide 
a reliable cover percentage. If the no-data proporton is less then maxNA the no-data pixels are removed 
from the total number of pixels when calculating the percent cover.
