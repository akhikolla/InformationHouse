\title{Estimate Image Haze for Dark Object Subtraction (DOS)}
\usage{
estimateHaze(x, hazeBands, darkProp = 0.01, maxSlope = TRUE,
  plot = FALSE, returnTables = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Raster* object or a previous result from \code{estimateHaze} with \code{returnTables = TRUE} from which to estimate haze}

\item{hazeBands}{Integer or Character. Band number or bandname from which to estimate atmospheric haze (optional if x contains only one layer)}

\item{darkProp}{Numeric. Proportion of pixels estimated to be dark.}

\item{maxSlope}{Logical. Use \code{darkProp} only as an upper boundary and search for the DN of maximum slope in the histogram below this value.}

\item{plot}{Logical. Option to display histograms and haze values}

\item{returnTables}{Logical. Option to return the frequency table per layer. Only takes effect if x is a Raster* object. If x is a result of estimateHaze tables will always be returned.}
}
\value{
If returnTables is FALSE (default). Then a vector of length(hazeBands) containing the estimated haze DNs will be returned.
If returnTables is TRUE a list with two components will be returned. The list element 'SHV' contains the haze values, while 'table' 
contains another list with the sampled frequency tables. The latter can be re-used to try different darkProp thresholds without having to sample 
the raster again.
}
\description{
estimates the digital number (DN) pixel value of *dark* objects for the visible wavelength range.
}
\details{
It is assumed that any radiation originating from *dark* pixels is due to atmospheric haze and 
not the reflectance of the surface itself (the surface is dark, i.e. it has a reflectance close to zero).
Hence, the haze values are estimates of path radiance, which can be subtracted in a dark object subtraction (DOS) procedure (see \code{\link{radCor}})

Atmospheric haze affects almost exclusively the visible wavelength range. Therefore, typically, you'd only want to estimate haze in blue, green and red bands, occasionally also in the nir band.

\examples{
data(lsat)

## Estimate haze for blue, green and red band
haze <- estimateHaze(lsat, hazeBands = 1:3, plot = TRUE)
haze

## Find threshold interactively
#### Return the frequency tables for re-use 
#### avoids having to sample the Raster again and again
haze <- estimateHaze(lsat, hazeBands = 1:3, returnTables = TRUE)
## Use frequency table instead of lsat and fiddle with 
haze <- estimateHaze(haze, hazeBands = 1:3, darkProp = .1, plot = TRUE)
haze$SHV
