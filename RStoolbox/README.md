RStoolbox is an R package providing a wide range of tools for your every-day remote sensing processing needs. The available tool-set covers many aspects from data import, pre-processing, data analysis, image classification and graphical display. RStoolbox builds upon the raster package, which makes it suitable for processing large data-sets even on smaller workstations. Moreover in most parts decent support for parallel processing is implemented.
