abstract = {AbstractThis paper examines normalized forms of Stone's two methods for predicting three-phase relative permeabilities. Recommendations are made on selection of the residual oil parameter, S om, in Method I. The methods are tested against selected published three-phase experimental data, using the plotting program called CPS-1 to infer improved data fitting. It is concluded that the normalized Method I with the recommended form for S om, is superior to Method II. IntroductionStone has produced two methods for estimating three-phase relative permeability from two-phase data. Both models assume a dominant wetting phase (usually water), a dominant nonwetting phase (gas), and an intermediate wetting phase (usually oil). The relative permeabilities for the water and gas are assumed to permeabilities for the water and gas are assumed to depend entirely on their individual saturations because they occupy the smallest and largest pores, respectively. The oil occupies the intermediate-size pores so that the oil relative permeability is an unknown function of water and gas saturation. For his first method, Stone proposed a formula for oil relative, permeability that was a product of oil relative permeability in the absence of gas, oil relative permeability in the absence of gas, oil relative permeability in the absence of mobile water, and some permeability in the absence of mobile water, and some variable scaling factors. He compared this formula with the experimental results of Corey et al., Dalton et al., and Saraf and Fatt. The formula is likely to be most in error at low oil relative permeability where more data are needed that show the behavior of residual oil saturation as a function of mixed gas and water saturations. In particular, the best value for the parameter S om that occurs in the model is not well resolved. In his second method, Stone developed a new formula and compared it against the data of Corey et al., Dalton et al., Saraf And Fatt, and some residual oil data from Holmgren and Morse. Stone suggested that his second method gave reasonable agreement with experiments without the need to include the parameter S om. If in the absence of residual oil data, S om = 0 is used in the first method, the second method is then better than the first method, although it tends to underpredict relative permeability. Dietrich and Bondor later showed that Stone's second method did not adequately approximate the two-phase data unless the oil relative permeability at connate water saturation, k rocw, was close to unity. Dietrich and Bondor suggested a normalization that achieved consistency with the two-phase data when k rocw, was not unity. This normalization can be unsatisfactory because k ro can exceed unity in some saturation ranges if k rocw is small. More recently this objection has been overcome by the normalization of Method II introduced by Aziz and Settari. Aziz and Settari also pointed out a similar normalization problem with Stone's first method and suggested an alternative to overcome the deficiency. However, no attempt was made to investigate the accuracy of these normalized formulas with respect to experimental data. In the next section of the paper we review the principal forms of Stone's formulas, and introduce some new ideas on the use and choice of the parameter S om. Later we examine the first of Stone's assumptions that water and gas relative permeabilities are functions only of their respective saturations for a water-wet system. This involves a critical review of all the published experimental measurements. Earlier reviews did not take into account some of the available data. Last, we examine the predictions of normalized Stone's methods for oil relative permeability against the more reliable experimental results. It is concluded that the normalized Stone's Method I with the improved definition of S om is more accurate than the normalized Method II. Mathematical Definition of Three-Phase Relative Permeabilities We briefly review the principal forms of the Stone's formulas that use the two-phase relative permeabilities defined by water/oil displacement in the absence of gas, k rw = k rw (S w) and k row = k row (S w) and gas/oil displacement in the presence of connate water, k rg = k rg (S g) and k rog = k rog (S g).

abstract = {With the method described here, three-phase relative permeability data may be estimated from two sets of more easily measured two-phase data - water displacing oil, and gas displacing oil. The resulting data compare favorably with the limited experimental data available in the literature, so that they may be used to estimate three-phase data for combination-drive reservoir calculations. IntroductionAlthough thorough analysis of combination gas- and water-drive reservoirs requires three-phase relative permeability data, the effort involved in determining permeability data, the effort involved in determining these data experimentally generally rules out such a direct approach. Refs. 1 through 4 suggest, however, that more easily measured two-phase data can be used to predict the relative permeability to both the wetting and nonwetting fluids in three-phase flow. This report describes a method of using two sets of two-phase data to predict the relative permeability of the intermediate wettability phase in a three-phase system. Use is made of probability concepts and appropriate empirical definitions. This technique may be regarded as a means of interpolating between the two sets of two-phase data to obtain the three-phase relative permeability. In many reservoirs that involve three-phase flow, only gas and oil are mobile in the upper portion of the reservoir; in the lower portion, water and oil are the phases of high mobility. The probability model is phases of high mobility. The probability model is such that it will yield the correct two-phase data when only two phases are flowing, and will provide interpolated data for three-phase flow that are consistent and continuous functions of the phase saturations. It will be shown later that these interpolated values agree with the available three-phase data within experimental uncertainty. Although the method applies to either a preferentially water-wet or a preferentially oil-wet system, preferentially water-wet or a preferentially oil-wet system, this discussion will be limited to a water-wet system. Extension of the method to a preferentially oil-wet system is straightforward; here, water becomes the fluid of intermediate wettability. Estimation of Three-Phase Relative Permeability Data Permeability Data This section presents the data required to predict three-phase relative permeability data, the equations used, and the definitions and assumptions on which the method is based. The next section describes a reasonable physical model that is consistent with these assumptions, and the final section presents an empirical evaluation of the model: Data Required Data required for the estimation of three-phase relative permeability are two sets of two-phase data water-oil and gas-oil. From the water-oil data we obtain both krw and krow, as a function of water saturation, where krow is defined as the relative permeability to oil in the oil-water two-phase system. Similarly, we obtain krg and krog as a function of gas saturation. Hysteresis effects are taken into consideration, as far as possible, by employing the appropriate two-phase data. For example, consider a water-wet system in which oil saturation is decreasing and gas and water saturations are increasing. Imbibition data should be used for the water-oil data, and drainage data should be used for the oil-gas data. JPT P. 214},

abstract = {Abstract Several correlations have been proposed for prediction of three-phase relative permeability from two-phase data or from saturation/capillary-pressure relationships. These include the models of Stone, Hirasaki, Corey et al., Naar and Wygal, Land, Aleman, and Parker et al. This paper compares predictions of these models with predictions of two additional models (saturation-weighted interpolation and true-linear interpolation). The comparison is made using all the published three-phase experimental relative permeability data complete enough for application of the models. The comparison shows that the models are often not very good predictors of the experimental data. This points out a need for better relative permeability models in cases where three-phase flow may have a significant effect. In most cases, straight-line interpolation or saturation-weighted interpolation between the permeabilities at the two-phase boundaries of the three-phase flow region provided a better fit of the experimental data than did the theoretically-based models. The paper also demonstrates the utility of comparing the effects of different relative permeability models before using them in a reservoir simulation. Sometimes the result of a simulation can be heavily biased by the choice of relative permeability model used. Introduction Three-phase relative permeability measurements and correlation methods have been reported in the literature since 1941. This paper lists the sources of published three-phase relative permeability data and compares the simple correlation methods which have been proposed for prediction of three-phase relative permeability. Two additional interpolation methods are proposed and compared to the published methods. Discussion Data Sources for Three-Phase Relative Permeability Three-phase (gas/oil/water) relative permeability data for water-wet sandpacks have been reported by Leverett and Lewis, Reid, Hosain, Snell and Ivanov. Three-phase data for water-wet cores have been reported by Caudle, et al. Corey, et al. Sarem, Donaldson and Dean, Saraf, Juckert; Saraf et al., van Spronsen, Holmgren and Morse, Slack and Ehrlich and Schneider and Owens. Very limited three-phase data for oil-wet cores (gas and water relative permeabilities at constant, non-flowing oil saturation) were published by Schneider and Owens. Descriptions of the test procedures and calculation methods are available in the original references. Donaldson and Kayser provide a summary of the test protocols and results for most of the data published prior to 1980. The data for water-wet cores and for sandpacks show generally consistent behavior; isoperms (contours of constant phase relative permeability) for gas and water primarily depend on the gas or water saturation respectively, and are weak functions of the saturations of other phases present. The permeability to each phase is clearly affected by the saturation history when there is hysteresis between the inhibition and drainage curves for that phase. These data indicate that a strongly wetting phase (water) and a non-wetting phase (gas) are affected little by interactions with other phases (except for the physical obstruction caused by the presence of the other phases). An intermediate wetting phase (oil) appears to be more influenced by interactions with the other phases. The nature of the inter action is not clear, however. P. 539{\^{}}},
