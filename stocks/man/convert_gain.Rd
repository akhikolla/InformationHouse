\title{Convert Gain from One Time Interval to Another}
\usage{
convert_gain(gain, units.in = 1, units.out = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{gain}{Numeric value specifying a gain, e.g. 0.005 for 0.5%. Can also be 
a vector of gains.}

\item{units.in}{Numeric value gving the time period over which the gain was 
achieved.}

\item{units.out}{Numeric value giving the time period you want to convert to.}
}
\value{
Numeric value or vector.
}
\description{
For example, you can use this function to figure out that an 8% gain over 70 
trading days is 31.9% annualized.
}
\examples{
# Calculate annualized gain for an 8\% gain over a 70-day period
convert_gain(gain = 0.08, units.in = 70, units.out = 252)

# Calculate the annual growth rate of a fund that gains 0.02\% per day
convert_gain(gain = 0.0002, units.in = 1, units.out = 252)

# Calculate the annual growth rate of a fund that gains 1\% per week
convert_gain(gain = 0.01, units.in = 1, units.out = 52)

# You invest in AAPL and gain 0.5\% in 17 business days. Express as a 5-year
# growth rate.
convert_gain(gain = 0.005, units.in = 17, units.out = 252 * 5)

# Your portfolio has tripled in a 13-year period. Calculate your average 
# annual gain.
convert_gain(gain = 2, units.in = 13, units.out = 1)
