Description: Implementation of the augmented
            Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) algorithm proposed by Yi et al. (2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.922777>
            for analyzing the data with mixed measurement error and misclassification. The main
            function provides a similar summary output as that of glm() function. Both parametric and
            empirical SIMEX are considered in the package.
