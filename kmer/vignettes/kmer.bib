abstract = {Summary: Analysis of Phylogenetics and Evolution (APE) is a package written in the R language for use in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. APE provides both utility functions for reading and writing data and manipulating phylogenetic trees, as well as several advanced methods for phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis (e.g. comparative and population genetic methods). APE takes advantage of the many R functions for statistics and graphics, and also provides a flexible framework for developing and implementing further statistical methods for the analysis of evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Circular layout is an efficient way for the visualization of huge amounts of genomic information. Here we present the circlize package, which provides an implementation of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available software. The flexibility of this package is based on the usage of low-level graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamless connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R, circlize gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding genomic patterns behind multi-dimensional data.},

@article{Kimura1980,
abstract = {Some simple formulae were obtained which enable us to estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differ-ences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or "tran-sition" type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimi-dine, the difference is called type I1 (or "transversion" type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = --(1/2) In {\{}(1 --2P --Q) {\~{}} z -{\~{}} {\}} . The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the syn-onymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is esti-mated by K' S = --(1/2) In (1 --2P --0.). Also, formulae for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were worked out using reported globin se-quences to show that synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution. During the last few years, rapid sequencing of DNA has become feasible, and data on nucleotide sequences of various parts of the genome in diverse organisms have started to accumulate at an accelerated pace. Each new report on such sequences Contribution No. 1330 from the National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, 411 Japan 0022--2844/80/0016/0111/{\~{}} 02.00 112 M. Kimura invites evolutionary considerations through comparative studies. Therefore, it is de-sirable if good statistical methods are established for estimating evolutionary distances between homologous sequences in terms of the number of nucleotide base substitutions. Recently, Miyata and Yasunaga (1980) proposed a new method for this purpose. Theil method consists in tracing, through successive one step changes, all the possible paths (restricted by the assumption of "the minimum substitution number") for each pair of codons compared, giving each step its due weight based on relative acceptance rates of amino acid substitutions. Using this method they succeeded in revealing some inter-esting properties of synonymous base substitutions. One drawback of their method, however, is that it is too tedious. The purpose of this note is to derive some simple formulae which enable us to ob-tain reliable estimates on the evolutionary distances between two nucleotide sequences compared. The present method of estimation is not only handy but also has the merit of incorporating the possibility that sometimes "transition" type substitutions may oc-cur more frequently than "transversion" type substitutions. Let us compare two homologous sequences and suppose that n nucleotide sites are involved. In what follows, we express sequences in terms of RNA codes, so that the four bases are designated by letters U, C, A and G. Now, we fix our attention on one of the n sites, and investigate how the homologous sites in two species differentiate from each other in the course of evolution, starting from a common ancestor T years back. Since there are 4 possibilities with respect to a base occupied at each site, there are 16 combinations of base pairs when the homol-ogous sites in two species are compared. These are listed in Table 1. For example, UU in the first line represents the case in which homologous sites in the first and sec-ond species are both occupied by base U. Similarly, UC in the second line represents the case in which homologous sites in the first and second species are occupied by U and C. Table 1. Types of nucleotide base pairs occupied at homologous sites in two species. Type I difference includes four cases in which both are purines or both are pyrimidines (line 2). Type II difference consists of eight cases in which one of the bases is a purine and the other is a pyri-midine (lines 3 and 4).},

@article{Blackshields2010,
abstract = {Background: The most widely used multiple sequence alignment methods require sequences to be clustered as an initial step. Most sequence clustering methods require a full distance matrix to be computed between all pairs of sequences. This requires memory and time proportional to N 2 for N sequences. When N grows larger than 10,000 or so, this becomes increasingly prohibitive and can form a significant barrier to carrying out very large multiple alignments. Results: In this paper, we have tested variations on a class of embedding methods that have been designed for clustering large numbers of complex objects where the individual distance calculations are expensive. These methods involve embedding the sequences in a space where the similarities within a set of sequences can be closely approximated without having to compute all pair-wise distances. Conclusions: We show how this approach greatly reduces computation time and memory requirements for clustering large numbers of sequences and demonstrate the quality of the clusterings by benchmarking them as guide trees for multiple alignment.

abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments are fundamental to many sequence analysis methods. Most alignments are computed using the progressive alignment heuristic. These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

abstract = {We sequenced 965 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b from 102 woodmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) collected from 40 European localities. The aims of the study were to answer the following questions. (i) Did the Mediterranean peninsulas play a role as refuge for woodmice? (ii) Is genetic variability of A. sylvaticus higher in the Mediterranean region compared with northern Europe? (iii) Are the patterns of the postglacial colonization of Europe by woodmice similar to those presently recognized for other European species? The results provide a clear picture of the impact of the Quaternary glaciations on the genetic and geographical structure of the woodmouse. Our analyses indicate a higher genetic variability of woodmice in the Mediterranean peninsulas compared to northern Europe, suggesting a role of the former as refuge regions for this small mammal. An original pattern of postglacial colonization is proposed where the Iberian and southern France refuge populations colonized almost all European regions. The Sicilian population appears to be very differentiated and highly variable. This emphasizes the importance of this island as a 'hot spot' for the intraspecific genetic diversity of the woodmouse. Finally, woodmice in North Africa originated from southwestern Europe, most probably as a result of a recent anthropogenic introduction.},
