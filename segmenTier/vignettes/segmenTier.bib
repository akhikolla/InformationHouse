        abstract = {The segmentation of time series and genomic data is a common problem
in computational biology. With increasingly complex measurement
procedures individual data points are often not just numbers or
simple vectors in which all  components are of the same kind.
Analysis methods that capitalize on slopes in a  single real-valued
data track or that make explicit use of the vectorial nature of
the data are not applicable in such scenaria. We develop here
a framework for  segmentation in arbitrary data domains that only
requires a minimal notion of similarity. Using unsupervised clustering
of (a sample of) the input yields an approximate segmentation
algorithm that is efficient enough for genome-wide applications.
As a showcase application we segment a time-series of transcriptome
sequencing data from budding yeast, in high temporal resolution
over ca. 2.5 cycles of the short-period respiratory oscillation.
The algorithm is used with a  similarity measure focussing on
periodic expression profiles across the metabolic cycle rather
than coverage per time point.}

        abstract = {When grown in continuous culture, budding yeast cells tend to
synchronize their respiratory activity to form a stable oscillation
that percolates throughout cellular physiology and involves the
majority of the protein-coding transcriptome. Oscillations in
batch culture and at single cell level support the idea that these
dynamics constitute a general growth principle. The precise molecular
mechanisms and biological functions of the oscillation remain
elusive.  Fourier analysis of transcriptome time series datasets
from two different oscillation periods (0.7 h and 5 h) reveals
seven distinct co-expression clusters common to both systems (34\%
of all yeast ORF), which consolidate into two superclusters when
correlated with a compilation of 1,327 unrelated transcriptome
datasets. These superclusters encode for cell growth and anabolism
during the phase of high, and mitochondrial growth, catabolism
and stress response during the phase of low oxygen uptake. The
promoters of each cluster are characterized by different nucleotide
contents, promoter nucleosome configurations, and dependence on
ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes. We show that the
ATP:ADP ratio oscillates, compatible with alternating metabolic
activity of the two superclusters and differential feedback on
their transcription via activating (RSC) and repressive (Isw2)
types of promoter structure remodeling. We propose a  novel feedback
mechanism, where the energetic state of the cell, reflected in
the ATP:ADP ratio, gates the transcription of large, but functionally
coherent groups of genes via differential effects of ATP-dependent
nucleosome remodeling machineries. Besides providing a mechanistic
hypothesis for the delayed negative  feedback that results in
the oscillatory phenotype, this mechanism may underpin the continuous
adaptation of growth to environmental conditions.}

        abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transcriptomes of several cyanobacterial strains
have been shown  to exhibit diurnal oscillation patterns, reflecting
the diurnal phototrophic lifestyle of the organisms.The analysis
of such genome-wide transcriptional oscillations is often facilitated
by the use of clustering algorithms in conjunction with a number
of pre-processing steps. Biological interpretation is usually
focussed on the time and phase of expression of the resulting
groups of genes.However, the use of microarray technology in such
studies requires the normalization of pre-processing data, with
unclear impact on the qualitative and  quantitative features of
the derived information on the number of oscillating transcripts
and their respective phases. RESULTS: A microarray based evaluation
of diurnal expression in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 is presented. As expected, the temporal expression patterns
reveal strong oscillations in transcript abundance.We compare
the Fourier transformation-based  expression phase before and
after the application of quantile normalization, median polishing,
cyclical LOESS, and least oscillating set (LOS) normalization.Whereas
LOS normalization mostly preserves the phases of the raw data,
the remaining methods introduce systematic biases. In particular,
quantile-normalization is found to introduce a phase-shift of
180 degrees , effectively changing night-expressed genes into
day-expressed ones. Comparison of a large number of clustering
results of differently normalized data shows that the normalization
method determines the result. Subsequent steps, such as the choice
of data transformation, similarity measure, and clustering algorithm,
only play minor roles.We find that the standardization and the
DTF transformation are  favorable for the clustering of time series
in contrast to the 12m transformation. We use the cluster-wise
functional enrichment of a clustering derived by LOS normalization,
clustering using flowClust, and DFT transformation  to derive
the diurnal biological program of Synechocystis sp.. CONCLUSION:
Application of quantile normalization, median polishing, and also
cyclic LOESS normalization of the presented cyanobacterial dataset
lead to increased numbers of oscillating genes and the systematic
shift of the expression phase. The LOS normalization minimizes
the observed detrimental effects. As previous analyses employed
a variety of different normalization methods, a direct comparison
of results must be treated with caution.}

h. These cellular clocks allow organisms to anticipate the environmental
cycles of day and night by synchronizing circadian rhythms with
the rising and setting of the sun. These rhythms originate from
the oscillator components of circadian clocks and control  global
gene expression and various cellular processes. The oscillator
of photosynthetic cyanobacteria is composed of three proteins,
KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, linked to a complex regulatory network.
Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 possesses the standard cyanobacterial
kaiABC gene cluster plus multiple kaiB and  kaiC gene copies and
antisense RNAs for almost every kai transcript. However, there
is no clear evidence of circadian rhythms in Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 under various experimental conditions. It is also still
unknown if and to what extent the multiple kai gene copies and
kai antisense RNAs affect circadian timing. Moreover, a large
number of small noncoding RNAs whose accumulation dynamics over
time have not yet been monitored are known for Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803. Here we performed a 48-h time series transcriptome analysis
of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, taking into account periodic light-dark
phases, continuous light, and continuous darkness. We found that
expression of functionally related genes occurred in different
phases of day and night. Moreover, we found day-peaking and night-peaking
transcripts among the small RNAs; in particular, the amounts of
kai antisense RNAs correlated or anticorrelated with those of
their respective kai target mRNAs, pointing toward the regulatory
relevance of these antisense RNAs. Surprisingly, we observed that
the amounts of 16S and 23S rRNAs in this cyanobacterium fluctuated
in light-dark  periods, showing maximum accumulation in the dark
phase. Importantly, the amounts of all transcripts, including
small noncoding RNAs, did not show any rhythm under continuous
light or darkness, indicating the absence of circadian rhythms
in Synechocystis.}
