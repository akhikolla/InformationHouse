\title{Shared Nearest Neighbors}
\description{
Calculates the number of shared nearest neighbors and the shared nearest neighbor similarity defined by
  Javis and Patrick (1973).
}
\usage{
sNN(x, k, kt = NULL, jp = FALSE, sort = TRUE, search = "kdtree", bucketSize = 10,
  splitRule = "suggest", approx = 0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ a data matrix, a dist object or a kNN object. }
  \item{k}{ number of neighbors to consider to calculate the shared nearest neighbors. }
  \item{kt}{ threshold on the number of shared nearest neighbors graph. Edges
    are only preserved if \code{kt} or more neighbors are shared. }
  \item{jp}{ use the definition by Javis and Patrick (1973), where shared neighbors are only counted between points that are in each other's neighborhood, otherwise 0 is returned. If FALSE, then the number of shared neighbors is returned, even if the points are not neighbors. }
  \item{search}{ nearest neighbor search strategy (one of "kdtree", "linear"
      or "dist").}
  \item{sort}{ sort by the number of shared nearest neighbors? Note that this is expensive and
      \code{sort = FALSE} is much faster. sNN objects can be sorted using
      \code{sort()}.}
  \item{bucketSize}{ max size of the kd-tree leafs. }
  \item{splitRule}{ rule to split the kd-tree. One of "STD",
      "MIDPT", "FAIR", "SL_MIDPT", "SL_FAIR" or "SUGGEST"
      (SL stands for sliding). "SUGGEST" uses ANNs best guess.}
  \item{approx}{ use approximate nearest neighbors. All NN up to a distance of
    a factor of 1+\code{approx} eps may be used. Some actual NN may be
    omitted leading to spurious clusters and noise points.
    However, the algorithm will enjoy a significant speedup. }
}
\details{
The number of shared nearest neighbors is the intersection of the
kNN neighborhood of two points. Note: that each point is considered to be part
of its own kNN neighborhood. The range for the shared nearest neighbors is
[0,k].
}
\value{
An object of class sNN (subclass of kNN and NN) containing a list with the following components:
  \item{id }{a matrix with ids. }
  \item{dist }{a matrix with the distances. }
  \item{shared }{a matrix with the number of shared nearest neighbors. }
  \item{k }{number of k used. }
%% ...
}

\code{\link{NN}} and \code{\link{kNN}} for k nearest neighbors.
